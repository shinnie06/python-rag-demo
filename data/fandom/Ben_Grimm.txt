Benjamin J "Ben" Grimm is an astronaut whose skin was mutated to become a rock-like being publicly known as the Thing, who is also a founding member of the Fantastic Four. When they were warned by Silver Surfer that Galactus sought to consume Earth, Grimm and the team attempted to negotiate with him, only to fail, as Galactus wanted to make Franklin Richards, the son of fellow teammates Reed Richards and Sue Storm, his successor. Back on Earth, when the team's attempt to teleport Earth away from Galactus was thwarted by Silver Surfer, Grimm and the team participated in the Battle of New York, successfully using the last Teleportation Bridge to banish the devourer, although Sue sacrificed herself to save the world. She was eventually resurrected by Franklin and Grimm celebrated their victory with his team.
