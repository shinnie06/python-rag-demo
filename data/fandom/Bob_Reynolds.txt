Robert "Bob" Reynolds is a former meth addict who took part in Project Sentry, an operation by O.X.E. designed to create the ultimate superhero. Unlike the project's other test subjects, Reynolds survived the experiments and gained immense power, but he was deemed a failure due to the instability caused by a combination of his new state coupled with his prior mental health issues and stored in the O.X.E. Vault with his memory partially wiped. He was later freed during a conflict between Yelena Belova, U.S. Agent, and Ghost, and had to join forces with them to escape alive. Reynolds soon discovered his abilities and was brought before Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, who provided him with a suit and dubbed him Sentry.

At de Fontaine's behest, he easily defeated Belova and the Thunderbolts; however, he soon grew uncontrollable, and his dark alter ego, Void, was unleashed, spreading darkness across Manhattan and trapping the residents in pocket realms based on their individual negative memories. The Thunderbolts managed to help Reynolds free himself from Void and return to normal, releasing Manhattan's residents. In the aftermath, Reynolds stayed with the Thunderbolts as they were redubbed the New Avengers by de Fontaine, though he abstained from continuing to use his powers out of a worry that becoming Sentry again might allow Void to return.

## Biography

 

### Early Life

#### Troubled Childhood

 from his father]]
 
Bob Reynolds lived with his mother and father in Sarasota Springs, Florida. During his childhood, Reynolds suffered domestic abuse from his father while his mother would manipulate him, leaving him emotionally and mentally scarred. While in middle school, Reynolds was involved in a car accident that led to him becoming addicted to orally-administered morphine. He also developed a way to keep himself from sneezing by saying the word "cucumber" over and over. 

#### Staying Afloat

 ]]
 
Reynolds managed to finish middle school in spite of his addiction, but quickly dropped out of high school soon after. Struggling with addiction, Reynolds took a job as a chicken mascot for Alfredo's Bail Bonds but was fired when he attacked a civilian while under the influence of . 

### Project Sentry

#### Volunteering for O.X.E.

 ]]
 
Reynolds soon traveled to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in hopes of finding either a purpose in life or simply more drugs. There, he was approached by a man working for O.X.E. who informed him about Project Sentry, a program involving a trial drug with the ability to turn anyone into the best version of themselves. Seeking fulfillment, Reynolds agreed to take part in the trial. He was brought to the O.X.E. Kuala Lumpur Research Facility, where he was injected with the drug.
 ]]
Despite Reynolds being merely a test subject not intended to be used for the project's goals, he gained immense superhuman abilities from the serum. However, it also exacerbated the loneliness and mental illness he had suffered from throughout his life. These feelings gained physical manifestation as Void, a dark entity that embodied Reynolds' trauma. Void turned two O.X.E. scientists into shadows before Reynolds fell into a comatose state, which led the rest of the project's personnel to believe he had died like all of the other subjects. He was thus deemed a failure and stored in a preservation pod that was shipped to the O.X.E. Vault. 

#### Waking Up

 
 
When the United States Congress began the process of the prosecution of Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, director of the CIA and founder of O.X.E., for her illegal activities with the organization, de Fontaine began erasing any evidence of Project Sentry, including Reynolds. She also sent her enforcers, Ghost, Yelena Belova, U.S. Agent, and Taskmaster, to the O.X.E. Vault with missions to kill each other, as she considered them evidence.
 
When the four arrived, a battle broke out, and U.S. Agent knocked a table into Reynolds' containment module, releasing him. Upon getting his bearings, Reynolds hid behind containers while de Fontaine's enforcers fought each other. However, when he witnessed Ghost shooting Taskmaster in the head, Reynolds could not keep his composure and began vomiting, revealing himself to the group. They all aimed their guns at Reynolds, so he raised his hands in surrender.
 
Reynolds nervously asked if Taskmaster was truly dead and tried to run, but the doors slammed shut. Ghost asked Reynolds who he was. He told the group his name, prompting Belova to ask who had sent him to the vault. Reynolds, confused, informed them that nobody had sent him and that he could not remember how he got there. Belova and the group then realized that they all worked for de Fontaine and that she had sent them to the vault to kill each other, so they lowered their guns.
 
Reynolds listened as U.S. Agent began describing the horrible deeds they had all done, including Taskmaster's activity in Budapest and Belova's past in the Red Room, although Ghost rebutted, calling U.S. Agent the dime store Captain America. Ghost, having been sent to kill Taskmaster, told Reynolds and the group she was leaving, but when she tried to phase through the doors, she was unable to, experiencing immense pain after setting off an sonic perimeter defense system designed specifically against her.
 
The vault then began to heat up and a two-minute timer began ticking down, causing Ghost to realize that de Fontaine's backup plan was to incinerate them all. The group understood that whatever was keeping Ghost from phasing through the doors must have been running on an independent power source, so Reynolds began looking for it so Ghost could phase through and open the doors. Soon, Belova called out to the group that she had found something.
 
They came over to Belova and discovered a power box, so U.S. Agent bashed it in with his shield, deactivating it. Ghost then ran through the doors, leaving Reynolds, Belova, and U.S. Agent to wait for her to open them. As the timer ticked down to twenty seconds, Reynolds realized Ghost was not coming back for them. However, with the three seconds remaining, the doors slid open, and Reynolds and the others ran through them as fire blasted out of the ceiling. 

#### Escaping the Vault

 kill a girl]]
 
Reynolds and the group were knocked forward by the blast, rendering them unconscious. Reynolds' hand touched Yelena Belova's, transporting him to one of her memories. A young Belova hid from another girl in a snowy forest, and when she revealed herself, she apologized. A man then emerged from behind Belova, and Reynolds watched in shock as the man shot the other girl dead.
 ]]
Reynolds awakened back in the O.X.E. Vault and pulled his hand away from Belova's. Belova also regained consciousness and asked Reynolds if he was okay, so he told her he was. Beside them, John Walker awoke and expressed disbelief that Ava Starr had saved them, but she revealed she had only done so because the power to the elevator had been cut off. Walker confronted Reynolds about how he entered the vault, but Belova defended him.
 talk in the vault]]
Feeling defeated, Reynolds encouraged Belova to abandon him, but she bonded with him over the emptiness they both felt, with Belova advising Reynolds to burrow it into a void. Walker called Reynolds and Belova over as he had managed to break through the concrete around the elevator with his shield. The group entered the elevator and climbed atop it, looking up and seeing that the elevator shaft was incredibly high.
 shimmy up the shaft]]
Walker told the group to stand back and jumped up the shaft with his abilities gained from the Super Soldier Serum, but he fell back down, commenting that the shaft was higher than he thought. Reynolds told the group he had an idea, and they all sat down with their backs pressed together and their feet to the wall. They then began to walk up the shaft, although they had to take many breaks. Reynolds looked down and noticed how high up he was, expressing his fear of heights.
 starts arguing]]
Nevertheless, the group continued on, and soon, they reached the top of the shaft. U.S. Agent told Belova to give him one of her batons and spin him around, but she told him they would all fall. Reynolds then felt the urge to sneeze, prompting him to repeat the word "cucumber." He explained to the group why he was doing this, but he soon could no longer talk as the urge grew stronger. The group desperately yelled the word, knowing they would all fall to their deaths if Reynolds lost control.
 ]]
Out of patience, Walker grabbed Belova's baton and opened the door, causing Reynolds and the other two to fall. Starr caught herself with Taskmaster's sword while Belova grabbed onto her and used the line from her Black Widow's Bite to catch the falling Reynolds, who sneezed. Walker then pulled the other three up the shaft, snarkily calling Reynolds "Bobby" and remarking that he must have skipped arm, chest and leg day as he was unable to pull himself up.
 
However, as Reynolds grabbed Walker's hand, he inadvertently transported Walker to a memory of him neglecting his child while reading an article about his downfall as Captain America. In the memory, Olivia Walker, Walker's wife, reprimanded Walker, but he told her to watch their son herself if she did not approve of his methods. Walker returned to his senses and looked at Reynolds in confusion, who had already walked away. The group looked out from behind a wall to the entrance to the vault, seeing that the exit was blocked by O.X.E. The group began talking about their pasts again, and Belova mentioned her former peewee soccer team, the West Chesapeake Valley Thunderbolts.
 
Returning to the situation at hand, Reynolds listened as Belova explained her plan: she would cause an explosion and turn the power off, causing O.X.E. to enter with night-vision, before turning the power back on, blinding the agents and allowing Walker to easily dispose of them. Walker interjected that something was bound to go wrong, but Belova ignored him, telling Starr that she needed to procure an escape vehicle.
 in the vault]]
Starr disappeared to search for one before Belova caused the explosion, and the group split up. Reynolds and Belova traveled to the electrical room, where Belova began getting the power back on. Reynolds offered to help, believing the medical trial he underwent had made him stronger as promised, but Belova shot down the idea as he was still slightly amnesiac. Despite flicking all the necessary switches, the power did not come back on, so Reynolds and Belova rushed out of the room to find Walker.
 fight O.X.E.]]
The two noticed that gas had been thrown into the vault, so they donned gas masks retrieved from fallen agents. Reynolds soon heard the sounds of gunshots, so he and Belova followed the noise. They encountered a group of O.X.E. agents, and Belova fought them. Reynolds again tried to help Belova, but she tied him to her back and continued to fight. Despite this, Reynolds managed to get a gun, and when he asked Belova what he was supposed to do with it, she exasperatedly told him to point and shoot. Soon, they had taken out the agents and continued on. As they were about to round a corner, another O.X.E. agent surprised them, causing Reynolds to shoot at him.
 ]]
However, the agent blocked the gunshots with a shield, screamed for Reynolds to stop, and threw off his mask, revealing he was Walker in disguise. Reynolds listened as Belova and Walker briefly bickered, with Walker telling Belova that he was right about her plan failing as there were too many variables. Nevertheless, Reynolds and Belova quickly donned O.X.E. uniforms and exited the vault with Walker. 
 

#### Discovering His Powers

 vault in disguise]]
 
As Reynolds, Yelena Belova, and John Walker made their way out of the vault and through the O.X.E. brigade, they passed directly by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, who was talking to her assistant Mel Gold. Walker cynically commented that Ava Starr had most likely abandoned them, but at that moment, a truck pulled up behind the three and Starr revealed herself at the wheel, telling them to get in.
 
Reynolds got in the back of the truck, and Belova asked him if he would be fine sitting there, to which he replied in the affirmative. Walker took over driving from Starr, who sat next to Belova in the front. Walker then began driving out of the O.X.E. camp and nearly made it out, but he was stopped by an agent. Reynolds listened as Walker and the agent squabbled back and forth, with Walker trying to deflect from the agent's questions.
 with a gun]]
Eventually, the agent caught on to Walker's deception, causing him and other nearby O.X.E. agents to draw their guns. Knowing he had to allow his friends to escape, Reynolds exited the vehicle, took off his gear, and began shooting the gun he had acquired into the air while running back towards the entrance to the vault. His distraction worked, as the agents who had been surrounding Walker's truck rushed to respond to the disturbance.
 
O.X.E. agents surrounded Reynolds, and at Holt's command, they began shooting him. Reynolds fell to the ground, and the agents stopped firing. However, Reynolds was unharmed and slowly got back up, looking down at his undamaged skin in shock. He suddenly began to levitate before launching into the sky. Reynolds hovered above the clouds for a few seconds before passing out, plummeting back towards the ground, and crashing into the mountainside. 

### Becoming a Hero

#### Meeting the Contessa

 ]]
 
The unconscious Reynolds was recovered by O.X.E., packed into a container, and transported to the Watchtower in New York City. There, he awoke in a bed and found Valentina Allegra de Fontaine waiting for him. Confused by his situation, Reynolds questioned where he was and what had happened to the friends he was with.
 's falsities]]
De Fontaine lied to him, saying that they were villains who intended to harm him, and cast herself as an ally, telling Reynolds that he was perfect and that she was the only one who could see that. She continued ingratiating herself to him by labeling him as special for surviving Project Sentry and overcoming the abuse of his father, but at the mention of the latter, Reynolds grew defensive and told de Fontaine he had not permitted her to discuss that subject.
 ]]
He unwittingly caused the building's lights to flicker; when she touched his hand, de Fontaine experienced a flashback to a memory of her childhood, where she witnessed the murder of her own father; shaken by this, she attempted to step out of the room, but Reynolds claimed he could control his abilities. A short time later, O.X.E. personnel were working on constructing Reynolds' new blue and yellow superhero suit.
 
During the suit's creation, Reynolds attempted to train himself in the use of his powers. With de Fontaine's encouragement, he tried to telekinetically move a glass of water. Though he failed at first, he continued trying, and as de Fontaine told him to focus, he managed to move the glass before accidentally boiling the water and bursting the glass. Despite this mistake, de Fontaine praised him, not noticing a golden shimmer in his eyes. 

#### Fighting His Friends

 ]]
 
The Thunderbolts, who had teamed up with Winter Soldier after Mel Gold alerted him to Valentina Allegra de Fontaine going too far with Project Sentry, soon arrived at the Watchtower and launched an assault on its lobby. De Fontaine summoned them to the upper floors, and when Winter Soldier tried to arrest her, Reynolds generated a force field around her to stop him. At de Fontaine's urging, Reynolds descended the stairs to present himself, now wearing the Sentry Suit and sporting newly-dyed blond hair. 
 ]]
His friends remarked on his change of attire while Reynolds stood next to de Fontaine. The contessa then introduced Reynolds as Sentry, who nervously greeted the Thunderbolts before Red Guardian commented that his name was cool. De Fontaine explained that Sentry was all-powerful, invulnerable, and stronger than every Avenger combined, finishing by saying he would soon be known as Earth's Mightiest Hero. 

Ghost questioned whether Sentry had dyed his hair, to which he informed her that it was de Fontaine's idea. Winter Soldier asked de Fontaine what her plan was. De Fontaine laughed at the fact that Winter Soldier had not caught on, causing Red Guardian to tell her they would not let her hurt anyone. De Fontaine assured him that the only people getting hurt would be them, explaining that the press would witness Sentry defeating the team.
 's shield via his arm]]
De Fontaine gave Sentry his mission, so the Thunderbolts readied for battle. Sentry told them that he did not want to fight them, but Red Guardian yelled that they stop talking and fight. Crying their team name, he ran to punch Sentry, but Sentry easily knocked him back into the wall. Winter Soldier drew his guns while Ghost and U.S. Agent ran at Sentry. Yelena Belova tried to stop them, but U.S. Agent threw his shield at Sentry.
 's bullets in air]]
However, Sentry easily blocked it and began fighting Ghost and U.S. Agent. Belova ran up to them to get them to stop fighting, but Sentry knocked all three of them back telekinetically. Winter Soldier, having a clear shot now, began shooting at Sentry, who rose his hand to block the bullets. He inadvertently stopped them in the air, so he flung them back at Winter Soldier, but U.S. Agent blocked them with his shield.
 out of a window]]
Red Guardian ran at Sentry once again with a knife and tried to stab him, but Sentry blocked the weapon with his powers. Red Guardian went behind Sentry and repeatedly hit him with the knife, but it had no effect on his invulnerable foe. Sentry flung Red Guardian out of the Watchtower, holding him the air for a short while before pulling him back into the building and slamming him into the Watchtower's bar.
 's shield]]
Ghost appeared behind Sentry and attempted to attack him, but Sentry flew behind her and punched her. U.S. Agent then slammed his shield into Sentry's face, and when he tried to hit Sentry again, Sentry grabbed his shield and bent it before knocking him away as well. Winter Soldier tried to stab him, but Sentry stopped him. Winter Soldier shot at Sentry, who flew behind him, punched him upwards, caught him in midair, and swatted him away.
 's bites]]
Sentry lowered himself to the ground, where Belova jumped on his back and tried to electrocute him with her Black Widow's Bite, begging him to stop. Unfazed, Sentry flew into the ceiling and caused Belova to hit it, and when she fell back down, Sentry grabbed her and launched her towards the elevator. Ghost tried to phase and attack Sentry, leading him to grab her by the neck in her intangible form and return her to normal.
 tangible and stops her]]
U.S. Agent shot Sentry while he was distracted with Ghost, but he was unharmed and simply superheated U.S. Agent's gun, causing him to drop it and clutch his hand in pain. Behind Sentry, Red Guardian emerged from the wreckage of the bar and grabbed a bar stool to throw at Sentry. However, Sentry noticed him and ripped the entire bar from the ground, slamming it into Red Guardian and sending the super soldier sprawling.
 ]]
Sentry pulled U.S. Agent to him with his powers and threw both him and Ghost towards the elevator. He watched Belova, Ghost, U.S. Agent, and Red Guardian as they lie on the floor and tried to catch their breath. However, Winter Soldier was still standing, and he charged at Sentry. Sentry let Winter Soldier punch him a few times before catching his prosthetic arm, yanking it off, and using it to smack Winter Soldier over to the rest of the Thunderbolts.
 ' retreat]]
Throwing the arm to the Thunderbolts, Sentry watched as they scrambled to retreat from the Watchtower, with Ghost grabbing Winter Soldier's prothestic arm and U.S. Agent and Red Guardian helping him get into the elevator. De Fontaine emerged from her hiding place behind the destroyed bar and exclaimed she was happy the Thunderbolts got a taste of Sentry's power. She told Sentry to finish them, but he refused, letting them escape.
 
De Fontaine questioned why Sentry had not finished the Thunderbolts off as instructed, but he replied that they were no longer a threat to him, so he saw it as unnecessary. Annoyed by his defiance, de Fontaine began arguing with him over the chain of command, reminding him that he was to follow her orders, but Sentry rejected this, objecting to her control over his hair, his name, his suit and his missions.
 ]]
He then turned her own words against her, stating that as she had described him as stronger than all the Avengers combined and the Avengers had at least one god in their ranks, this meant he was as strong as a god and did not have to take orders from anyone. Realizing that Sentry had turned against her, de Fontaine covertly readied the Sentry Kill Switch, but Sentry grabbed her by the neck and pinned her against the wall, causing her to drop it. 
 ]]
Sentry angrily accused de Fontaine of planning to betray him, just as his former friends and everyone else had. She defiantly asserted that she was not afraid of him, addressing him as "Robert," but Sentry ominously warned her that it was not Robert she needed to be afraid of. Before he could strangle her to death, Mel picked up and set off the kill switch, seemingly terminating him. De Fontaine and Mel left, unaware of the shadows in the room as Sentry turned pitch-black and awakened as Void. 

#### Attack on Manhattan

 soldiers]]
 
Now fully under Void's control, Reynolds floated out of the Watchtower and looked over Manhattan. O.X.E. soldiers called to dispose of his body informed Valentina Allegra de Fontaine and Mel Gold that there was no corpse present and opened fire on him from the tower, but with a simple wave of his hand, he turned them into shadows.
 ]]
Witnessing this from the ground, de Fontaine called in Holt aboard an O.X.E. helicopter equipped with heavier weapons. These too had no effect on Void, and he transformed both Holt and the pilot into shadows, causing the helicopter to crash into a construction crane, which then collapsed into the surrounding buildings. The Thunderbolts mobilized to protect the civilians from the falling debris, with Red Guardian shielding a young girl from a giant piece of wreckage. However, Void soon transformed the girl into a shadow, along with a number of other civilians nearby.
 
Void, disappointed by the people below him trying to escape his influence, soon unleashed a giant shadow that spread across Manhattan. Everyone it touched was turned into a shadow, causing the city to descend into bedlam as the people tried in vain to escape. The Thunderbolts did what they could to help the citizens, to little effect. With their efforts proving useless, Yelena Belova stepped out to face Void directly. Realizing that she had to reach Reynolds inside Void's field of influence, Belova willingly entered the darkness and was turned into a shadow. 

#### Comforted by Yelena Belova

 ]]
 
Inside the world within Void's influence, Yelena Belova faced a series of traumatic memories from her own life as she tried to find Reynolds. She eventually managed to find him in a memory of his childhood home, which he described to her as the most comforting room inside Void. Reynolds opened up to Belova about his inner torment, explaining that he had days where he felt invincible, but that there were more days where everything felt hopeless, and where he would remember that nothing mattered.
 are attacked by Void]]
Although Reynolds was ready to give up and displayed little motivation to try and escape Void, Belova comforted him by identifying with his pain as someone struggling with her own mental health. This encouraged Reynolds enough to get him to stand up, but his newfound strength angered Void, who retaliated by throwing the objects in the room around. Suddenly, the other Thunderbolts arrived to aid them, having willingly entered the shadows themselves and faced their own traumatic memories. 

#### Facing Void

 ]]
 
Now united, Reynolds and the Thunderbolts set out to find the "worst room" within Void in order to return to the real world. U.S. Agent punched Reynolds' father so they could leave the memory of his childhood home, and they then arrived in Reynolds' memory of working for Alfredo's Bail Bonds, where his past, methamphetamine-addicted self attacked them while wearing the chicken costume. Reynolds cowered at the memory and desperately tried to explain it as a product of his addiction, but they were able to move on after Winter Soldier knocked the past version of Reynolds out.
 face Void]]
Finally, the group arrived at their destination, which turned out to be Reynolds' memory of the O.X.E. Kuala Lumpur Research Facility, where he had received the Golden Sentry Serum during Project Sentry. There, they found Void waiting for them, sitting near the shadows of the scientists he had attacked when he emerged for the first time following Reynolds receiving the serum. Void stood up and mocked them for opposing him, focusing his most bitter insults on Reynolds. Summoning his courage, Reynolds argued against Void's declaration of their shared isolation, but it failed to persuade Void at all.
 
Void, growing irritated with Reynolds' resistance, turned his powers on the Thunderbolts, pinning them down and injuring them by telekinetically shattering glass and battering them with objects from the lab. Reynolds became angry and warned Void not to harm them, and swore that he was stronger than Void. His dark counterpart merely laughed this off, dismissing the threat by saying they would see if it were true.
 
Having had enough of Void's torment, Reynolds attacked him, and they began fighting. Initially, Void appeared to have the upper hand, but as Reynolds' anger grew, he was able to overpower Void, knock him to the ground, and begin battering him. However, this was what Void wanted to happen. As Reynolds continued to beat him, his darkness began creeping up Reynolds' body. The Thunderbolts, realizing that Void was deceiving Reynolds into harming himself and that Void was consuming Reynolds' soul, called out to him in vain, trying to get him to stop.
 ]]
They were able to break free from the restraints Void placed them under, and led by Yelena Belova, they embraced Reynolds and told him he was not alone. Void attempted to tell Reynolds that he and Void would always only have each other, but the Thunderbolts managed to get through to Reynolds in time to save him. Overwhelmed by the realization that he had people who cared about him, Reynolds stopped beating Void and broke down crying. 

#### New Team

 
Empowered by his friends, Reynolds was able to take back control from Void, undoing the effects of his darkness on Manhattan and releasing all the people that had become shadows. He and the Thunderbolts returned to reality, but Reynolds lacked any memory of what had happened inside Void, was no longer able to use his powers, and had reverted back to his original hair color. The Sentry Suit had also disappeared. U.S. Agent expressed concern over what would happen when Reynolds' memory returned, so Yelena Belova told Reynolds they would stick together, an idea Reynolds found nice.
 's announcement]]
With the threat over, Reynolds followed the Thunderbolts as they moved to arrest Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. When they were tricked into taking part in her press conference renaming them the New Avengers, Reynolds stood by and applauded them, not realizing how they had been used by de Fontaine.

Following this, de Fontaine allowed the New Avengers to use the Watchtower as their base of operations, and Reynolds took up residence there with them. 

### New Avengers

#### Witnessing a Spaceship

 
 
Fourteen months later, Bob and the New Avengers came into conflict with Sam Wilson over their name, during which Bob revealed that he was abstaining from using his powers due to the possibility of Void coming back. Upon having a meal with his friends and "doing the dishes," Reynolds and the others spot an unidentified spaceship approaching Earth's atmosphere on their monitor. 

## Powers and Abilities

### Powers

 
*Artificially Enhanced Physiology: As a result of a trial drug administered by Project Sentry, Sentry possesses a multitude of powers and abilities that make him a very powerful superhero and, when under the influence of Void, an extremely dangerous threat. He possesses physical attributes that far exceed Super Soldiers such as Bucky Barnes, John Walker and Red Guardian, as well as many other supernatural abilities.
**Superhuman Strength: ]] Sentry possesses unprecedented levels of strength. He was able to effortlessly overpower the Thunderbolts during their fight, in which he easily bent John Walker's Shield, overpowered Bucky Barnes and caught a punch from his Prosthetic Arm with one hand before ripping it off.
**Superhuman Durability: Sentry's body is capable of withstanding extreme forms of physical trauma with no visible damage to his exterior. Bullets of the highest caliber don't phase him, and falling from high altitudes at extreme velocities are similarly ineffective. He was likewise unharmed by any of the attacks by the Thunderbolts, including punches from Bucky Barnes, Red Guardian's knife attacks which caused the knife to break, and electricity from Yelena's Black Widow's Bite. However, Sentry can still be harmed as the kill switch was able to temporarily disable him until Void took over.
**Superhuman Speed: Sentry is capable of moving at speeds faster than the eye can follow, appearing as a blur of motion and able to cover the distance of a room almost instantaneously. He was able to easily outpace the Thunderbolts and react to their attacks. Sentry is also able to propel himself through the air at high speeds.
**Superhuman Agility: Sentry is much more agile than any normal human being, with perfect agility, equilibrium, flexibility, dexterity, balance, and body coordination. He was able to dodge Red Guardian’s attacks agilely and even outmaneuver him in battle.
**Superhuman Stamina: Sentry possesses extraordinary levels of stamina, able to fight numerous opponents without effort or signs of fatigue.
**Superhuman Reflexes: Sentry can react to attacks and objects moving at high speeds. He could react to and counter the attacks by the Thunderbolts with minimal effort, including catching a punch from Bucky Barnes and evading gunshots.
**Regenerative Healing Factor: Sentry was killed at one point by a kill switch designed to stop him if anything went wrong with the Project, but fully healed in a matter of minutes.
**Flight: ]] Sentry is able to fly and levitate; he is able to hover at any distance over the ground and can propel himself through the air at great speeds. When he first displayed this ability, Sentry accidentally hurled himself hundreds of feet into air, before rapidly dropping, however since then he has displayed greater control, being able to ascend and descend at will, as well as being able to control the speed at which he flies.
**Psionics: Sentry possesses various psionic abilities in addition to his physical attributes, allowing him to directly interact with reality using his mind to a degree.
***Telekinesis: Sentry is able to move and manipulate objects and people with his mind. By simply gesturing his hand, Sentry was able to telekinetically hurl Red Guardian through a window, briefly holding him in place before pulling him back into the watchtower, and launched furniture at Red Guardian to stop him. He could halt several bullets in the air and fling them back at the shooter, and halt Red Guardian's knife in place, preventing the knife from reaching him. 
***Tactile Telepathy: Sentry is able to interact with the minds of others. By making physical contact with others, he is able to share in the memories of others; he was able to view Yelena's first task for the Red Room, as well as cause Walker to experience a shameful memory about his wife and child, and de Fontaine to experience a traumatic memory about her father's murder.
***Matter Manipulation: Sentry is able to psychically control and manipulate matter; enabling him to grab onto Ghost in her intangible form, and stop her from phasing.
***Heat Generation: Sentry can generate high amounts of heat remotely. When testing his telekinetic powers to move a glass of water, he accidentally boiled the contents of the glass and, during his fight with the Thunderbolts, he superheated John Walker's gun by looking at it like a heat vision, causing him to drop it. He also superheated Bucky Barnes' Prosthetic Arm.
**Darkness Manipulation: ers to his realm]] Empowered by Void, Robert's shadow becomes a focal point, allowing him to unleash a rapidly expanding darkness that can engulf a significant portion of a city and eventually the entire universe. In this uncontrollable state, his very being transforms into a walking shadow, save for his distinctly visible blank pupils, with even his voice shifting to reflect this completely separate personality. With a mere flip of his hand, he can banish others into a dimension contained within this supernatural darkness, a place that forces them to confront their worst memories, which appear in the form of interconnected rooms. Each room contains a painful memory from the victim's past, which repeats itself continually. Void possesses control over these memories and can directly speak through the people involved in them, as well as telekinetically manipulate the objects and landscapes in them. Victims cannot die in any fashion while trapped in this realm; Reynolds characterizes this as the pain Void can inflict only getting worse, even in situations that would normally result in death, such as strangulation.

### Abilities

*Combatant: Though lacking any formal training with his abilities, Sentry remains competent enough to utilize them to dominate the Thunderbolts and force them to retreat. Reynolds also fought and bested his dark alter ego Void.

## Equipment

### Other Equipment

*Sentry Suit: Sentry wears a blue and golden-yellow suit, supplied to him by O.X.E.. The suit appears to be made from a textured, high-tech synthetic fabric, the body and legs traced with angular black lines creating a geometric pattern that emphasizes the wearer's musculature, as well as dark gray paneling on the shoulders and neck, forming a semi-armored collar. The suit features metallic gray gauntlets with gold accents, a belt bearing the Sentry's letter "S" logo, a long, flowing blue cape, and dark blue, gold-lined boots as accessories. However, the suit's coloration turned completely black when Sentry was overtaken by Void, and it disappeared entirely after Reynolds took back control, leaving him in common civilian clothing instead.

## Facilities

*Reynolds Residence: Growing up, Reynolds lived in his family's house, with his mother and father.
*O.X.E. Kuala Lumpur Research Facility: Reynolds traveled to Kuala Lumpur, and resided in this facility during Project Sentry.
*Watchtower: Following Project Sentry, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine intended to use the Watchtower as her and Sentry's base of operations, but after Void's Attack on Manhattan, de Fontaine instead allowed the New Avengers, as well as Reynolds, to reside in the tower.

## Trivia

*In the comics, Robert Reynolds was an ordinary man, suffering from a crippling addiction and drank the Golden Sentry Serum to become very powerful, gaining matter and energy manipulation abilities in the process. During his crime-fighting career as Sentry, he has been part of several groups, such as Dark Avengers, Mighty Avengers, New Avengers, and the Horsemen of Death.
**However, Sentry was also bonded with a dark and powerful entity called "Void" when he consumed the serum. The entity acts as a counterforce and embodiment of Bob's negative aspects. It was later revealed that the dark entity was known as Angel of Death during 1600 BCE. During the King in Black storyline, Sentry was killed by Knull, who later assimilated Void into himself. However, it was destroyed when Eddie Brock and the God of Light used the Uni-Power to vaporize Knull in the sun.

## Behind the Scenes

*Interestingly, Pullman played a character named Bob in Top Gun: Maverick. This prompted him to ask director Jake Schreier to change the character's name around for the film as he didn't want to play another "Bob." However, the idea was shot down and Pullman was told that Bob had been established as Sentry's real name in the comics. Lewis Pullman wanted to change Thunderbolts character name: "I just played a Bob" 
*Thunderbolts* director Jake Schreier revealed in an interview that the film's writers originally intended to portray Sentry's origin story more faithfully to the source material, where Robert Reynolds had the world's knowledge of his existence erased in order to stop Void from emerging. This backstory was altered due to its similarity to the climax in Spider-Man: No Way Home, where Doctor Strange casts a spell that similarly wipes the world's memory of Peter Parker's secret identity as Spider-Man, in order to protect his loved ones.
