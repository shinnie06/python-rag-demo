## Trivia

*In the comics, Doctor Doom is the king of Latveria and the archenemy of the Fantastic Four, primarily Reed Richards. He and Richards have been rivals since their time in college, during which he used his mastery over science and sorcery to create a transdimensional machine but ignored Richards' attempt at fixing a small mistake; the machine exploded in Doom's face. Scarred and expelled, Doom later forged his mask and armor. As Doom blamed Richards for his accident, his animosity spanned decades and culminated in the 2015 event Secret Wars, when Doom seized the ultimate power of the Beyonders but inadvertently relinquished it to Richards during their climatic duel over the fate of the Multiverse.
