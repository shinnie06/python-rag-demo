Okoye is the former General of the Dora Milaje and the head of Wakandan armed forces and intel. Witnessing T'Challa's coronation, she joined him in tracking down Ulysses Klaue. When Erik Killmonger overthrew T'Challa, Okoye found herself conflicted between her friendship with T'Challa or her duty to her new king. T'Challa soon returned and Okoye soon joined him in the fight against Killmonger and successfully taking back the throne. 

When Thanos and his forces arrived on Earth to forcefully take the Mind Stone from Vision, Okoye soon was forced to defend Wakanda alongside her king and the Avengers. Although they succeeded in killing Thanos' forces when Thanos himself came on Wakanda, Okoye and the other heroes were completely overpowered and unable to stop him from completing the Infinity Gauntlet, though Okoye remained one of the survivors.

In the wake of the Snap, Okoye joined the Avengers, serving under the command of Natasha Romanoff whilst simultaneously leading the Dora Milaje in Wakanda. After the Blip in 2023, which resurrected all the lives claimed by the Snap, she joined T'Challa and the Wakandans to provide aid for the Avengers during the Battle of Earth, killing Corvus Glaive. Following the aftermath of the battle, with the Avengers now defunct, she returned to Wakanda and resumed serving T'Challa.

With the death of T'Challa and a looming threat of Namor, the duty to protect Wakanda and vibranium fell on Okoye's shoulders again. Together with Shuri, Okoye attempted to protect Riri Williams from the Talokanil; however, Shuri ended up being captured. For recklessly putting the Princess in danger, Okoye was stripped from her rank as the Dora Milaje General by Ramonda. Seeking a way to redeem herself, Okoye continued to fight during the Talokanil-Wakandan War, which claimed Ramonda's life. Using the armors, created by Shuri, Okoye and Aneka became Midnight Angels and fought against the Talokanil during a final battle, as well as rescued Everett Ross from being arrested for helping Wakanda.

## Biography

### Early Life

### Joining the Dora Milaje

Okoye joined the Dora Milaje and started training, becoming the greatest warrior in Wakanda. She was promoted to General of the Dora Milaje. 

#### Following Terrorists

 track enemies of Wakanda]]
In 2008, on orders of T'Chaka, Okoye was sent with T'Challa when he went to save Wakandan hostages from Zanda and Douglas Scott, to report back on T'Challa's progress as the Black Panther. Saving the hostages while Black Panther distracted the mercenaries, Okoye ended up confronted by Scott. Once the hostages escaped, and the police stormed the building, the mercenaries fled, and Black Panther made Okoye return to their aircraft to follow them.

Following them to a yacht, Black Panther and Okoye took out the mercenaries and confronted Zanda and Scott. Okoye fought Scott again but was almost killed by a surprise attack, spared only when Black Panther dropped a metal bar on Scott's hands . Upon returning to Wakanda, Okoye told T'Chaka how T'Challa proved himself in the field, though left out how she assisted him in her report, despite T'Chaka deducing her part in the rescue mission. 

### T'Challa's Rule

#### Rescue of Nakia

 ]]
 
In 2016, a week after the death of the king of Wakanda, T'Chaka, T'Challa decided to retrieve Nakia from her current War Dogs mission as he wished for her to be present during his coronation. As a pilot for her king, Okoye and T'Challa flew a Royal Talon Fighter to Nigeria where Nakia was located.
 ]]
As T'Challa prepared for his mission by using one of the tablets to look at where Nakia and the missing are located, Okoye informed him where they're heading near the border of Wakanda. Getting up from her chair, Okoye was about to equip a Vibranium Spear by her side but was told by her king that he could handle the mission on his own, much to her surprise. Okoye then puts her Vibranium Spear aside and listened to T'Challa's word on getting Nakia out of the forest.
 to not freeze]]
Understanding her orders, Okoye gave Kimoyo Beads to T'Challa for the mission and told him to not freeze when Nakia arrives, as he countered that he never freezes in a confrontation. As T'Challa put on his helmet and dropped down the airship, Okoye observed her king from afar as the traffickers noticed the trucks were hit by an EMP. T'Challa ambushed the gunmen before he encountered a child soldier just until Nakia then arrived to save him.
 
As T'Challa and Nakia had a brief talk with each other, a surviving gunman tried to force them to surrender by threatening a hostage, only for Okoye to swiftly disarm and then run him through with her Vibranium Spear, saving T'Challa from a tough situation and ending the skirmish. Okoye teased T'Challa for his lack of focus and looked over the woman being held hostage. While Okoye rescues the women, T'Challa told of his father's death and invited her to the coronation.
 
Once Nakia agreed on T'Challa for participating in the coronation, she went over the women who are gathered and told them to go home and take the boy to his people. As Nakia left the group alone, Okoye confronted the women and told them not to speak about what happened that night, as they agreed on her terms. Okoye smiled at the women and left with bitter hope of returning home. Okoye piloted the Royal Talon Fighter with T'Challa and Nakia on board. 

#### Returning Back Home

 ]]
 
Upon on the horizon, Okoye and T'Challa succeeded in their mission and headed on home to Wakanda with Nakia. As the sun rises from above, T'Challa was comforted by Nakia, as they were deeply saddened by the former king T'Chaka's death. While T'Challa and Nakia had converse, Okoye piloted the Royal Talon Fighter until they reached their destination.
 ]]
While heading near the mountains of her home, Okoye reached her destination and announced T'Challa their arrival as they flew by cloudy ruins of the mountains and pass the Border Tribe people that are waving back at them. As they were getting closer to the holographic dome, Okoye flew past it and arrived at Birnin Zana and landed on the helipad as the Dora Milaje were waiting for the prince's arrival.
 about T'Challa freezing]]
As the Queen Mother Ramonda and Shuri waited for the Royal Talon Fighter to release the shuttle, T'Challa walked out of the jet with Okoye and Nakia. Once Nakia had apologized for Ramonda's loss, Okoye told Ayo to escort her to the River Tribe, as she accepted. When Shuri asked if her brother froze upon seeing his ex, Okoye giddily confirmed, comparing him to "an antelope in headlights", as the two laughed. Once Okoye stopped joking, she gathered the Dora Milaje to leave the perimeter. 

#### Coronation of T'Challa

 join in the coronation]]
 
As T'Challa went to prepare for the ceremony, Okoye participated with the Dora Milaje for the prince's following preparation. As Shuri and Ramonda were ceremonial dancing as well as the other five tribes, Okoye commanded alongside the Dora Milaje and raised up their Vibranium Spear and send a sonic signal beneath the river to let a Royal Talon Fighter rise up from the shuttle and let the prince through the rivers of the land.
 challenging T'Challa]]
En route to Warrior Falls, as all of the tribes of Wakanda sailed along the river, with Okoye and the Dora Milaje leading as they awaited the arrival of T'Challa. Okoye watched T'Challa during his settlement with the five tribes but was later confronted with M'Baku of the Jabari Tribe. As the dispute resulted into a fight, T'Challa won the fight against M'Baku, as the crowd went wild with excitement and Okoye supporting him when he was crowned as King of Wakanda. 

#### Tracking Ulysses Klaue

 of Ulysses Klaue]]
 
While T'Challa took the time to visit the Border Tribe and see how W'Kabi was doing in his farm and talking about aiding other countries, Okoye alerted both of them through the use of their Kimoyo Beads to inform that a misidentified Wakandan artifact was stolen at the Museum of Great Britain and Ulysses Klaue had plans to sell it to an American buyer in South Korea.
 of Klaue]]
When the Tribal Council convened, Okoye informed them that Klaue would be in Busan. She supported a mission to capture or kill Klaue, arguing that it was too good an opportunity to let pass. T'Challa decided that he, along with Okoye and Nakia, would go to South Korea, promising W'Kabi that he will kill where he stands. As T'Challa had settled in the procedure with the mission by having a new Panther Habit, Okoye participated in the operation with the idea of using the disguise before tracking in Klaue's location. 

#### Arrest of Ulysses Klaue

 ]]
 
Once the group learned that Klaue had stolen a vibranium artifact from the Museum of Great Britain and was planning to sell it on the black market, Okoye joined T'Challa and Nakia to travel to Busan to arrest Ulysses Klaue. Getting out of the car, Okoye grumbled about the wig she was forced to wear as part of her disguise, expressing a desire for the mission to go quickly so she could remove it.
 ]]
Following Nakia, Okoye listened to her talking to a woman who owned a fish market business, telling her to gain passage with her friends. Okoye entered into Jagalchi Market Casino despite her suspicions of the woman. Upon entering, the group decided to split up to cover more area, with Okoye asking her partners to focus on the mission instead of having personal conversations. As Nakia sat at the bar and spotted some Americans, thus potential buyers to Klaue, Okoye saw more coming into the casino carrying diamonds, informing that the situation is a setup. Meanwhile, Okoye was informed by T'Challa that Everett Ross and the CIA was also present.
 's men]]
Klaue eventually arrived in the casino with more bodyguards, and Okoye noticed that all of them were armed. As Nakia intended to move forward against Klaue, Okoye instructed her to wait, but this caused her to be identified as a Wakandan hostile by a bodyguard. Knowing that her cover was no longer relevant, Okoye unsheathed her Vibranium Spear and took down the two bodyguards who attacked her. Klaue began a shootout in the casino and made an escape.
 chase down Ulysses Klaue]]
Okoye managed to defeat several bodyguards and left the casino with Nakia to chase Klaue who escaped with multiples SUVs. Pursuing, Okoye tossed a remote access Kimoyo Bead onto a parked car for T'Challa's use whilst she and Nakia gave chase in their vibranium car. Okoye and Nakia tailed onto one of Klaue's SUV, driving away on a two-lane street. Okoye informed Nakia that Klaue's henchmen are trying to lose them on each lane.
 
Further tailing Klaue's SUV, Okoye commented on the use of guns as primitive while the henchmen shot at their vibranium car. Getting calmly frustrated, Okoye slid out of the passenger window and climbed onto the roof of her own car while Nakia was driving, stabbing her Vibranium spear on the roof of the vehicle as a handle. Nakia dropped back and weaved through traffic as Okoye engaged her spear mechanism, then steadied herself and threw her spear at the rear SUV; the weapon went clean through both the rear and front windscreen to jam itself in the road, causing the SUV to crash into it and taking it out for the count.
 ]]
Leaving only Klaue's SUV to chase down, Okoye witnessed Klaue being retaliated and fired his prosthetic arm's sonic cannon, destroying Okoye's car. Flying in mid-air with car parts being in pieces, Okoye manages to catch her spear and land on the shredded roof of the car while Nakia skids towards her with the driver's seat and belt buckle intact. Being witnessed by Ross, Okoye and Nakia were picked up by him and took them to Klaue.
 to not kill Ulysses Klaue]]
Before Ross had managed to catch up to T'Challa, who had caused Klaue's car to crash before ripping out Klaue's prosthetic arm and threatening him with his Panther Claws. Seeing that T'Challa was preparing to execute Klaue on the spot in revenge, Okoye and Nakia had managed to convince him to stop as he was being filmed by several people. Following Klaue's arrest, Ross took everyone to the CIA South Korean Black Site. 

#### Helping Everett Ross

 being interrogated]]
 
With Ulysses Klaue finally in the custody of CIA, Okoye and T'Challa decided to go to the CIA South Korean Black Site, checking for answers of his past crimes. Taken into the interrogation room, Okoye looked after Klaue as he was handcuffed to chair from his hands and ankles and mockingly kissing at their mirrored glass where she was standing.
 for his attitude]]
When Everett Ross confronted them aside from the glass window, Okoye advised T'Challa not to leave Ross to interrogate Klaue alone. When Ross gently tapped T'Challa's shoulder, Okoye took offense and threatened to impale him to a desk if he did it again in , causing Ross to not understand what she said. T'Challa agreed to let Ross interrogate Klaue on his own while putting a bug on his shoulder to listen to him closely. T'Challa then told Okoye to be nice, despite her displeasement with Americans.
 's interrogation]]
Okoye watched in silence as Ross confronted T'Challa about Klaue's reveal that Wakanda actually had large supplies of Vibranium. Listening further, Okoye noticed T'Challa's realization of Klaue spilling out information about Wakanda that shouldn't be said. Once Ross stepped out of the room, T'Challa was confronted over Klaue's claims about Wakanda, then the conversation was interrupted when Nakia informed them an attack is being held at the moment, only for an explosion to hit near them in the interrogation room.
 
When an armed gunman breached the wall of the interrogation room and cause an explosion at the office, Okoye remained hidden and ready to attack but she witnessed a grenade being set off, only for Black Panther to stop it from exploding. As Klaue and his goons managed to escape in front of the base and Black Panther attempted to chase them down, Okoye noticed her king on the ground and informed him that someone has been shot.
 ]]
Okoye and T'Challa returned to the CIA facility where Ross had been heavily wounded while protecting Nakia. T'Challa used a Kimoyo Bead to stabilize his wound. Understanding the risks of bringing a foreign agent into his home, T'Challa ordered Ross brought to Wakanda to heal him, much to Okoye's confusion of his sudden decision. Despite the risk, Okoye brought Ross along the Royal Talon Fighter for medical attention.
 ]]
Traveling back to Wakanda, Okoye strongly advised T'Challa that they should have brought Klaue into the country instead of Ross, being a foreign intelligence agent. As Okoye object to the idea of Ross being taken into Wakanda before Nakia's life being saved, T'Challa decided to bring Ross to Wakanda for the reason that he can't just let him die knowing that he could save him. Asking T'Challa where Ross will be treated, Okoye was told that Shuri's Lab will suffice. 

#### Erik Killmonger's Arrival

 of an outsider]]
 
Gaining reports of an outsider from the Border Tribe, Okoye contacted Shuri, informing that a man showed up at the border claims to have killed Ulysses Klaue. With Shuri being confused, Okoye told her that W'Kabi is transporting the outsider to the Tribal Council and should warn T'Challa.
 ]]
When Okoye joined the throne room with the Tribal Council, she followed T'Challa as he stood up and came face to face with the man, who happened to be N'Jadaka, T'Challa's cousin, who went under the alias of Erik Killmonger. When Killmonger decided to reveal his name to the River Tribe Elder, Okoye witnessed the evidence by W'Kabi showing his Royal Ring. With the conflict between the people around him, T'Challa decided to accept the challenge from Killmonger.
 's defeat by Killmonger]]
As T'Challa and Killmonger were both taken to Warrior Falls to prepare for their duel, Okoye watched the duel between them before Nakia asked about where Everett Ross was, answering that he was locked in her office. Okoye then watched with growing anguish as Killmonger slowly gained the upper hand over T'Challa. When Zuri intervened the fight, he was killed by Killmonger, causing shock for Okoye. When the fight reached its end, Okoye could hardly keep her tears as Killmonger defeated T'Challa and watched in horror as Killmonger threw T'Challa down the waterfall. 

#### The New Ruler

 ]]
 
Following the duel, Okoye found Nakia, who had put Ramonda and Shuri in safety. Okoye then told Nakia that she could not follow them as she was bound to serve the throne of Wakanda no matter who sat on it. Therefore, Okoye let Nakia, Ramonda, and Shuri go into exile while she would reluctantly serve Erik Killmonger as her new King.
 's plan]]
Okoye attended Killmonger's first Tribal Council, where he explained his plan of delivering Vibranium weapons all over the world to start a global revolution. Okoye spoke against this plan, claiming that Wakanda has survived for so long by fighting when only absolutely necessary, only for W'Kabi to counter her argument and advocate for a change in Wakandan foreign policies before the outside world starts to catch up to them. As Killmonger began to tell her orders, Okoye was forced to comply with weapons to be sent throughout the world.
 ]]
Once the council had ended, Okoye argued with W'Kabi and questioned about how T'Challa was ever his friend. Knowing that W'Kabi had no problem having Killmonger murder T'Challa, Okoye was told that it was his choice which made her even angry for the loss. W'Kabi then told Okoye that he wanted justice for his family after they were killed by Ulysses Klaue, much to Okoye's dismissal. W'Kabi told Okoye that Wakanda will still stand tall and hugged her. 
 is alive]]
As Erik Killmonger and the Border Tribe prepared to deliver Vibranium weapons to War Dogs around the world, Okoye witnessed the first plane being destroyed and expressed considerable joy and relief when she saw T'Challa emerging from the remnants of the aircraft. As Killmonger ordered W'Kabi to kill T'Challa, Okoye tried to keep him from it by claiming that the ritual challenge was not over but W'Kabi ordered the Border Tribe to charge. 

#### Battle of Mount Bashenga

 begin to rebel]]
 
While T'Challa faced the Border Tribe, Okoye and the rest of the Dora Milaje, who now owe Killmonger nothing since he had just forfeited his legal claim to the throne by refusing to continue the duel with T'Challa, openly rebelled against Erik Killmonger, calling him unworthy of ruling over Wakanda. Okoye ordered Ayo to take the Dora Milaje on the battlefield to assist T'Challa while she and three other Dora Milaje would fight against Killmonger, who wore an upgraded version of the Panther Habit to fight them.
 ]]
Okoye and her soldiers furiously fought against Killmonger, who managed to withstand their assault and took Xoliswa captive. As he executed her, Okoye screamed in rage and the Dora Milaje resumed their attack. Okoye and the group managed to block Killmonger between their Vibranium Spears and almost stripped him of the necklace which enabled him to use his suit, but Killmonger released a burst of kinetic energy, sending Okoye away on the battlefield.
 ]]
Okoye found herself surrounded by members of the Border Tribe, putting up their holographic shields and threatened them with their White Rhinoceros. Okoye took down several opponents but ended up cornered by the Border Tribe with Shuri, Nakia and Ayo. As W'Kabi ordered them to surrender with a countdown, the support of the Jabari Tribe decided to side with T'Challa and helped them defeat the Border Tribe members.
 to surrender]]
When she saw M'Baku being charged by W'Kabi riding his war rhinoceros, Okoye ran to get between them, having the rhinoceros recognize Okoye and stopped in front of her. When W'Kabi stepped down, Okoye ordered her husband to surrender. W'Kabi, being visibly saddened, asked Okoye if she would kill him and replied that she would not hesitate to do it for Wakanda. Becoming convinced, W'Kabi laid down his weapon and Okoye arrested him in the field. 

#### Wakanda Moves Forward

 to Vienna]]
Heading over to United Nations, Okoye, T'Challa, Nakia, and Ayo walked into over to the Vienna International Centre. When Everett Ross arrived to meet up, T'Challa was greeted by him before being asked for a private conversation, to which T'Challa asked to give them space. Before leaving away from the conversation about revealing his Wakanda's secrets, T'Challa was wished good luck in , however, he mispronounced some words which caused Okoye and Ayo to laugh while Ross insisted that he practiced his phrase. As T'Challa thanked him for Ross attempt to impress him, Okoye visited along with her king into the conference. 
 conference]]
With T'Challa being fully reinstated as the rightful King of Wakanda, Okoye accompanied him to a United Nations meeting in Vienna. Okoye stood behind T'Challa as he announced that Wakanda would open to the rest of the world, and she mildly smiled as a delegate asked what Wakanda, which he believed to be a nation of farmers, could offer to the international community. 

### Infinity War

#### Greeting the Avengers

 . Maybe even a .|Okoye and T'Challa|Avengers: Infinity War}}
In 2018, Okoye and T'Challa went to see Bucky Barnes on the remote farm they had given him, and presented a Vibranium arm for him to wear. Soon after, the Avengers arrived in Birnin Zana, seeking T'Challa's help. Okoye accompanied him to meet them, remarking that when T'Challa planned to open Wakanda to the world, this was not what she had in mind. T'Challa asked her what she expected, to which Okoye replied that she had thought about the or a café.
 ]]
Okoye then went inside the Wakanda Medical Center and watched as Shuri spoke with Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, and Wanda Maximoff about removing the Mind Stone from Vision. As they were talking, Okoye received an alert and was notified of an alien craft coming into the atmosphere. 

#### Battle of Wakanda

 ]]
 
Okoye then rallied the Dora Milaje and prepared for battle on the fields, alongside the Avengers, M'Baku and the Jabari Tribe, the Border Tribe, and the Wakandan Royal Guard. She watched in horror as the Outriders began relentlessly charging into the Wakandan energy barrier, incinerating themselves with no regard for their own safety. She stood by T'Challa as he ordered a section of the barrier to be opened so that the enemy would funnel directly towards them.
 ]] 
During the battle, Okoye and Romanoff were nearly killed by the Threshers, but were saved by Wanda Maximoff, who Okoye inquired as to why she wasn't there the whole time. Later, she and Romanoff then teamed up to fight Proxima Midnight, who was attempting to kill Maximoff. As they fought her, Maximoff used her powers to lift Midnight into the path of one of the Threshers, killing her. 

#### Thanos' Victory

 ]]
 
Once the battle had ended, Okoye accompanied T'Challa into the forest with the other Avengers to protect Vision. She then witnessed Thanos’s arrival through a wormhole. In an attempt to prevent Thanos from reaching Vision, Okoye hurled her Sonic Spear at Thanos, but he easily repelled it with the Power Stone and then flung her away.
 fading into dust]]
Afterwards, Thanos took the Mind Stone from Vision and united the Infinity Stones into his Infinity Gauntlet and snapped his fingers. Okoye watched in absolute horror as T'Challa, who was trying to help her up, disintegrated into dust, causing her to cry out in clear alarm and confusion. 

### Working with the Avengers

#### Member of the Avengers

 ' meeting]]
 
Sometime later, Okoye began aiding the Avengers under Natasha Romanoff's leadership as they helped and protected Earth. In 2023, she, alongside Rocket, Nebula, James Rhodes, and Carol Danvers, reported in via holographic call to Romanoff to give her updates.
 ]]
When Romanoff asked Okoye about the tremors they detected, she told her that it was a mild subduction under the African plate. Romanoff then asked as to how they were handling it, but Okoye assured her that due to the nature of the situation, the way they would handle it was by not handling it. 

#### Battle of Earth

 against Thanos' army]]
 
Later, following the Blip, Okoye was reunited with her King and princess. Shortly after, they were recruited by the Masters of the Mystic Arts to join the ongoing battle against an alternate Thanos and his alien army at the ruins of the Avengers Compound. Okoye, alongside T'Challa and Shuri, walked through an Inter-Dimensional Portal and led the Wakandan armies to fight.
 in her task]]
Okoye then stood alongside the epic line of assembled heroes, as Captain America led the charge against the opposing army. As the battle proceeded, Okoye fought with great skill. During the battle, Okoye assisted Carol Danvers in her task to deliver the Nano Gauntlet to the Quantum Tunnel and helped fight off the fast-approaching horde.
 
The group of heroes charged at the horde and managed to fight them off. Okoye stabbed and killed Corvus Glaive with her Vibranium Spear. The battle was ultimately concluded when Tony Stark obtained the Infinity Stones and wiped out alternate Thanos and his army.
 's funeral]]
However, this action cost him his life. All the heroes, including Okoye, then showed their respect for the fallen hero and kneeled before him. A week later, despite not knowing him, Okoye attended Stark's funeral at his compound. 

### Training Assata

 ]]
 
Okoye learned that Assata, a young disabled girl, wanted to become a member of the Dora Milaje. She sat down with Assata and offered her a modified training regiment so that she could follow her dream. However, Assata refused Okoye's help, choosing instead to study science. However, Assata returned to Okoye sometime later, asking to be trained for the Dora Milaje. Okoye asked about Assata's belief that it was impossible to join the Dora Milaje, but Assata replied that she should follow her dreams, even if she had to take different paths. Okoye told Assata that her grandmother would be proud of her. She told Assata the first step to training was to remove obstacles that seemed impossible. Okoye then began training Assata to use a Vibranium Spear. 

### Losing T'Challa

#### T'Challa's Funeral

 ]]
In 2024, Okoye was heartbroken to hear the news that T'Challa was very sick. Although Shuri tried to save him, T'Challa passed away. At his funeral, Okoye sadly picked up the casket, crying for her king. She brought it to the Royal Talon Fighter where the casket got beamed up. She then crossed her arms in salute. 

#### Defending Wakanda's Outreach Center

 
 
A year later, Okoye and the Dora Milaje went to the Wakandan Outreach Center to protect the Vibranium. When mercenaries arrived, Aneka opened the door, allowing Okoye, Ayo, and Yama to slowly walk out of the door. The then fought the intruders, deflecting multiple bullets. Okoye displayed swift abilities while ridiculing Aneka, who had brought new Vibranium Daggers. Aneka claimed that Shuri gave her them, but Okoye told her to stick to the traditional Vibranium Spear.
 meeting]]
The next day, the Dora accompanied Ramonda to a United Nations meeting. Ramonda told the world that even without the Black Panther, they were still a threat. She then brought out the Dora, who displayed the apprehended mercenaries. Ramonda used this to show the world not to mess with them. 

### Losing Her Position

#### Threat from Namor

 ]]
Ramonda called an emergency meeting for the elders and revealed that Namor infiltrated the border and spoke to her and Shuri. He claimed that his country's problem was their mess. They had to help him fix it by giving him the scientist who created the Vibranium Detector. Okoye sat down in her seat as M'Baku arrived. The two of them traded insults until they were told to stop by Ramonda.
 ]]
In Shuri's lab, Okoye looked at the Midnight Angel Armor that Shuri had been preparing, stating that it was still ugly. Shuri then showed how she ripped apart the detector to see the parts. Okoye pulled Ramonda aside, asking her to let Shuri go with her to Cambridge to get the scientist. Ramonda initially refused, but Okoye argued that it would be a good way for Shuri to get out of her lab. 

#### Mission in Cambridge

 
 ]]
Okoye and Shuri scouted out the scientist in Cambridge, realizing that she was just a kid named Riri Williams. Shuri wanted to talk to Williams alone. Although Okoye was skeptical, she allowed her five minutes. She was also worried about her makeup, but Shuri claimed it was fine. Okoye hid in the bathroom of Williams' dorm. When Williams walked in, Okoye walked out.
 ]]
Scared, Williams grabbed a speaker and threw it at Okoye, who sliced it in half with her spear. Williams then freaked out that Okoye brought a spear in there, making fun of her makeup. Shuri then laughed as Okoye felt betrayed. Before leaving, Shuri said that they were going to leave Williams to get killed by Namor. Hearing who he was, Williams finally agreed to come.
 ]]
They drove to Riri Williams' Garage and walked in. Okoye looked around, seeing a car and scouting out the place while Williams grabbed her stuff. Suddenly, the FBI arrived, telling the Wakandans to come out. Okoye got into the car, telling Shuri to join her. Shuri claimed that they needed that space for Williams, but she left in her own homemade Iron Man style armor. Okoye then said there was no excuse, so Shuri got in. However, before leaving, she told Griot to get into auto drive. She then jumped out as Okoye left with Griot, without her consent. Shuri chased with a motorcycle.
 
The FBI drove and chased after Okoye, but then Okoye threatened Griot. Griot gave in and gave Okoye manual controls. Okoye threw the spear into the back of the car, sending it through the trunk. She used this to flip a car over before meeting up with Shuri. Suddenly, a surveillance drone, sent by Williams, landed on the officers, allowing them to escape. When they thought they were safe, a spear with a rope came out of the water, and they were blasted with a Hydrobomb.
 ]]
Okoye got up and rushed to Shuri, who was knocked out. She was then approached by the Talokanil. Okoye easily took care of the warriors, seemingly killing them all. She was then approached by Attuma, a bigger Talokanil. He told his army to take care of the police by aiding Namora. The Talokanil, who she thought were dead, simply got up and ran. Okoye then fought Attuma, trading blows.
 ]]
Attuma slammed her spear down and threw her into it. Instead of killing her, however, he threw Okoye her own spear back. Okoye was shocked but took it to keep fighting. They fought some more until Okoye was knocked down. Attuma was impressed, calling her warrior. However, he said that she was not worth his blade. So, he took her spear and prepared to kill her. This allowed Okoye to shock him with her Kimoyo Beads. Attuma dropped the spear and threw her.
 ]]
Okoye drifted backwards but rammed her spear into the ground to stop herself. Namora then returned, telling Attuma to stop playing games. She threw Attuma a water bomb. He deflected it at Okoye, sending her flying over the bridge. She emerged from the water and saw Shuri being taken. She screamed for Shuri, in horror. 

#### Stripped of Her Rank

 
 ]]
Okoye returned to Wakanda and reported what happened, saying she was going to get Shuri back. Ramonda was quiet at first, but simply told Okoye she was stripped from her rank as general, as well as her position on the Dora Milaje. Okoye broke down, telling Ramonda that she had given everything. M'Kathu stood up for Okoye, saying that she put a spear up to her own husband.
 ]]
Ramonda asked where her husband was; in a cell where she could visit him whenever she wanted. However, Ramonda did not have that luxury. She started yelling, saying she was Queen of the most powerful nation in the world and her entire family was gone, while questioning if she had not truly given everything. She stood by as Okoye was loyal to Erik Killmonger, so was everyone in the room. Today, she was done standing up for Okoye. Saddened, Okoye took her spear and stabbed it into the throne room floor before walking out. 

#### Failing to Make It Right

 ]]
Okoye decided that she needed to make it right. She walked out to a ship in order to save Shuri, but was stopped by Ayo. The new general told Okoye to stop under orders. Okoye did not care and moved further. The rest of the Dora Milaje then walked out towards Okoye, holding their spears to her. Ayo warned Okoye to back down as she did not want to spill her blood. Okoye complied to the warnings. 

#### Attack on Birnin Zana

 
 
Okoye talked to Nakia, who had rescued Shuri. Nakia had returned to Wakanda, so they tried to catch up. Suddenly, they saw water sprinkling into the city. They looked over to see flooding. Okoye yelled that they were under attack just before a tidal wave washed through. Okoye saw a boy in the middle of the walkway, searching for his parents. Okoye charged at him and hugged him, taking the force of the wave.
 's taunt]]
She got to a Royal Talon Fighter as she heard Attuma, who referred to her as warrior once again. She looked at him before telling the child to cross his arms so they could get beamed up. Okoye and Nakia then ran to the Citadel and found Riri Williams unconscious on the ground, but Ramonda underwater. Okoye lifted Ramonda up and out. She used her Kimoyo Beads to try to resuscitate Ramonda.
 ]]
As Shuri ran in, Okoye yelled at her to get back. Aneka and M'Baku held Shuri. Okoye tried to restart Ramonda's heart multiple times, but Nakia stopped her, saying it was over. Okoye cried over her queen, heartbroken as Shuri collapsed, crying. Okoye then attended Ramonda's funeral, crying. 

### A New Purpose

#### Daughter of the Border

 's idea]]
M'Kathu told Okoye that he wanted to meet with her, so Okoye rode a horse out to the Border Tribe. M'Kathu walked with Okoye, calling her the daughter of the border. He said that there was now a difficult decision for leader as they could get assassinated by Namor. He said that when they would do the incoronation, Okoye should challenge. Okoye did not believe that was right, but M'Kathu was worried about Shuri's leadership, especially when she was mourning. M'Kathu assured Okoye that she had the support of the people. 

#### Midnight Angel

 
 ]]
Okoye approached the mourning Shuri in her lab. Along with Nakia and Riri Williams, she helped Shuri recreate the Heart-Shaped Herb, allowing Shuri to become the Black Panther. As they set up to end the conflict, Okoye approached Aneka. She proposed that they become Midnight Angels, seeking a new purpose. 

#### Defeating the Warrior

 
 
The Wakandans lured the Talokanil to the Sea Leopard, staging an ambush. Okoye and Aneka flew in on their Midnight Angel Armor and took care of the Talokanil before getting onto the ship. Okoye immediately scouted out Attuma, calling him warrior in Yucatec Mayan. He noticed that she spoke the mother tongue, but it was time for her to join the ancestors.
 ]]
Okoye fought him for a while, before repeating the same thing to him. She then threw him off of the ship and into the water, finally defeating her foe. She then crowded with the Wakandans, fearing for their lives as they fought. Luckily, Black Panther and Namor returned from their own battle, announcing a truce. Shuri then chanted "Wakanda forever," as the warriors repeated it back. 

#### Leaving Wakanda

 out of the van]]
 
Okoye left Wakanda for good as she had a new purpose. She found the van that was taking the arrested Everett Ross. Using her Midnight Angel Armor, she knocked down a tree to stop the van. She then ripped open the back doors, scaring Ross, who realized it was Okoye. She then made a joke about Ross being "a colonizer in chains" before breaking him out. 
 ]]
Okoye followed Shuri to Haiti, where Shuri intended to move. Shuri noticed Okoye and said she did not need to always protect her. Okoye simply said she was saying goodbye as she wanted to see where her Midnight Angel Armor could take her. Shuri pointed out that she said it was ugly. Okoye admitted it was ugly for a Dora Milaje, which she was not. She then left Shuri, but not before saying that in the case of trouble, she would be there anywhere, anytime. 

## Powers and Abilities

### Powers

*Midnight Angels Armor Capabilities: Okoye was given an armor by Shuri after she was fired from her position on the Dora Milaje. The armor was blue and had a design that Okoye was not fond of.
**Superhuman Strength: While wearing the armor, Okoye's strength was tremendously increased to help her battle the Talokanil.
**Superhuman Durability: The armor gave Okoye an extra thick layer of protection in battle.
**Superhuman Speed: Okoye flew around the Sea Leopard at great speed, fast enough to catch up to Ironheart.
**Superhuman Agility: Okoye could perform many agile maneuvers in the air.
**Superhuman Stamina: While wearing the armor, Okoye did not need to exert a lot of energy which allowed her to battle the Talokanil for extended periods of time.
**Superhuman Reflexes: Okoye was able to dodge attacks during a battle against the Talokanil.
**Flight: The armor possessed thrusters that allowed her to fly through the air and attack airborne Talokanil.

### Abilities

 
 
*Master Martial Artist: ]] As the former General of the Dora Milaje, Okoye is an extremely skilled and formidable hand-to-hand combatant and martial artist, having trained extensively and immensely proficient in various forms of combat, marking her one of the greatest martial artists in Wakanda, only behind T'Challa. Okoye prefers to battle with her Vibranium Spear, which she was able to almost effortlessly incapacitate multiple foes at once during the casino fight. During the Battle of Mount Bashenga, Okoye managed to pin down Erik Killmonger alongside the other Doras and defeat many Border Tribe warriors without sustaining any injury. She has also proven to be capable of defeating many Outriders and competing against Proxima Midnight with aid from Black Widow, holding her off long enough for Wanda Maximoff to kill her, and during the Battle of Wakanda, surviving with no injuries, only being no match for Thanos himself, who easily flung her away. She went head-to-head with the very powerful Talokanil, Attuma. He respected her after their battle and called her by "warrior" during their rematches.
 
*Spear Mastery: ]] Okoye is extremely skilled at using her Vibranium Spear in close quarters combat and as a long-ranged weapon. She is also very accurate when throwing her spear, as she was able to throw it through a car's windshield and into the road to halt the vehicle. She also threw her spear at Thanos' face accurately while running, although it was stopped by the Mad Titan using the Space Stone. Okoye has taken out multiple enemies with her spear at once. During the Battle of Earth, Okoye is seen impaling and flinging away Corvus Glaive. She was able to take down four Talokanil at once with her spear and blocked many attacks by Attuma. After one attack, she used her spear to plant herself into the ground before flying off the edge of the bridge.
*Master Tactician: Okoye is the leader of the Dora Milaje. She led them through the Battle of Mount Bashenga, Battle of Wakanda, and the Battle of Earth. Her leadership earns her friendship and power with Black Panther and Wakanda. As a leader, she is also very loyal, having to choose the side of Erik Killmonger at first because of her duty as the leader. She eventually turned on him though.
*Expert Pilot: Okoye piloted the aircraft that brought T'Challa to Nakia then back to Wakanda.
 
*Multilingualism: Okoye is fluent in her native Xhosa, as well as English, French, Yucatec Maya, and Korean, as she was able to understand the exchange between Nakia and Sophia.

## Equipment

### Weapons

*Vibranium Spear: ]] Okoye uses a specialized Vibranium spear capable of collapsing into a handle for concealment. The spear is sharp enough to pierce a Vibranium car during the Arrest of Ulysses Klaue and is strong enough to stop an SUV, as seen when Okoye threw it through the windshield of Klaue's goons' vehicle and embedded it into the road ahead, totaling the vehicle on impact. Her spear along with others have been shown to be able to interact with technology by striking the ground with the blunt end, notably electrocuting an enemy during the brawl at the Jagalchi Market Casino, and activating the drainage system for Warrior Falls.

### Other Equipment

*Dora Milaje Armor: As the General of the Dora Milaje, Okoye wears a slightly more elaborated version of the Dora Milaje armor, notably with the epaulets, bracelets, and necklace being golden instead of silver. Being made of Vibranium weaves, the armor offers high durability and protection.
*Kimoyo Beads: Okoye used her Kimoyo Beads to project images to the Tribal Council and to control the Royal Talon Fighter.
*Magnetic Boots: Okoye wore boots with magnetic soles during the Arrest of Ulysses Klaue, using them to secure herself on the roof of the Vibranium car Nakia drove. 
*Midnight Angel Armor: Shuri made Midnight Angels Armor that was used by Okoye to fight with Talokanil in ambush after she was stripped of her rank as the General of the Dora Milaje by Queen Mother Ramonda.

## Behind the Scenes

*Janeshia Adams-Ginyard, Keisha Tucker, Jénel Stevens, Ivy Haralson and Nicole Day were stunt doubles for Danai Gurira in the role of Okoye.
*Shara London was a stand-in for Danai Gurira in the role of Okoye.
*Danai Gurira said that "She can be serious, but she also has an unexpected sense of humor. She has a heart, but for her country and for her people. She's not a person who doesn't connect to human beings as a result of what she does." From Michonne to Marvel Comics: Danai Gurira brings fierce loyalty to Black Panther 
*The strip of beadwork on the abdomen part of Okoye's Dora Milaje armor was inspired by a table runner from senior visual development illustrator Anthony Francisco's aunt's home while the rings on the tassels at the side of her uniform were meant to be good luck charms. Tribal Filipinos Were A Surprising Muse For ‘Black Panther’s’ Dora Milaje 
*Okoye was designed with Danai Gurira in mind before Gurira was cast in the role. Anthony Francisco designed her character based on Gurira, although he epxressed uncertainty about whether this influenced the choice to cast her.
