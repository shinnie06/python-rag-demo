The Space Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a singularity that predated the universe, representing the element of space. Housed within the Tesseract, over the course of history it was wielded by many individuals, including Johann Schmidt of Hydra, Mar-Vell of the Kree Empire, the Skrulls, and Loki of Asgard. During the Infinity War, the Tesseract was shattered by Thanos, who put the Space Stone inside his Infinity Gauntlet. Following the Snap, Thanos destroyed the Space Stone, along with the other five Infinity Stones.

In 2023, the Avengers initiated a Time Heist in order to resurrect the victims of the Snap. Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk and Ant-Man were sent back in time to 2012 during the Battle of New York to retrieve the Space, Time and Mind Stones. However, in this alternate timeline, Loki was able to get the Tesseract and used it to escape custody, forcing Captain America and Iron Man to time travel to April 1970 to retrieve another Tesseract. Following the Battle of Earth, where Iron Man used all six stones to kill Thanos and his army at the cost of his own life, Captain America returned the Space Stone to 1970, albeit without the Tesseract.

## History

### Origins

 
After the universe came to be, the Big Bang forged the remnants of six singularities into elemental crystals, dubbed the Infinity Stones, and hurtled them across the universe. Befitting its name, the Space Stone held dominion over the fabric of space being able to teleport its users anywhere in the universe. The Space Stone was eventually housed in a cubic containment device, which came to be known as the Tesseract. 

The earliest known people to possess the Space Stone were the Asgardians. Circa 965 A.D., Odin brought the Tesseract with him to planet Earth, in Tønsberg, Norway and left it there. In the legends of Norse mythology, the Tesseract came to be regarded as "the jewel of Odin's treasure room." 

### World War II

 
The Tesseract resurfaced in 1942 where it was procured by Red Skull who sought to use its power to mass-produce a line of advanced weaponry. The power he managed to extract was beyond what he imagined and gave him enough confidence to turn his back on the Third Reich entirely and make his own plans for world domination. In 1945, Schmidt managed to refine the Tesseract's power into a series of devastating bombs and a personal aircraft through which he intended to attack the United States of America.
 being teleported towards Vormir]]
His plane was boarded by Captain America, with the chaos of the fighting shaking the Tesseract free from its restraints. When Schmidt seized the artifact, it activated and, in disgust of his abuse of its power, banished him to Vormir, resting place of the Soul Stone, knowing he would never be able to make the sacrifice required for its power. The Tesseract then burned through the decks of the Valkyrie, eventually coming to rest in the Arctic Ocean where it was later recovered by Howard Stark. 
 finds the Tesseract in the ocean]]
After helping to found S.H.I.E.L.D., Howard Stark studied the Tesseract for some time and eventually theorized a new element based on its atomic structure. Due to the technology of his time, he was unable to actually synthesize the new element and instead substituted it with Palladium in his Arc Reactor prototypes. Howard left detailed notes on both the Tesseract and his new element in the hopes that his son would one day succeed where he had failed. Following Howard's passing, the Tesseract remained in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s care. 

### Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.

 
 
The Tesseract eventually found its way into the possession of Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Mar-Vell researched the Tesseract's power to create a Light-Speed Engine to help the Skrulls under her protection. Her research eventually drew the attention of Yon-Rogg who sought to claim the Tesseract for the Kree Empire only for the Light-Speed Engine to be destroyed when he came to confront the rogue scientist, its Space Stone derived energies bathing and bonding to Carol Danvers. In truth, the Tesseract had been safely stored in Mar-Vell's orbital laboratory.
 spits up the Tesseract]]
Six years later, the Starforce arrived at Mar-Vell's Laboratory to try and claim the cube but Danvers and her allies managed to keep it from the Kree, after Goose swallowed it, storing it in her pocket dimensions inside her body. Sometime afterwards, Goose regurgitated it. 

By 2010, the World Security Council had reactivated Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S., an attempt to harness the Tesseract's power into advanced weaponry. Following Thor's arrival on Earth, S.H.I.E.L.D. hired Doctor Erik Selvig to study the alien artifact and accelerate their progress. Selvig built the Tesseract Accelerator in an attempt to harness the Tesseract. 

### Loki's Invasion

 is created by the Space Stone]]
 
In 2012, Loki found himself in the Sanctuary and met Thanos who agreed to supply him with a Chitauri army with which to conquer Earth in exchange for the Tesseract. By remote manipulation of its energies, Loki used the Space Stone within the Tesseract to teleport himself to Earth and brainwashed several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and personnel, including Selvig and Clint Barton, to safely contain the Tesseract's energies within the Tesseract Accelerator to open a stable wormhole for the Chitauri to invade through. Though the Chitauri made planetfall in New York City, they were defeated by the newly formed Avengers. Afterwards, Thor used the power of the Space Stone within the Tesseract to take it, along with himself and Loki, back to Asgard. 

### On Asgard

 ]]
 
Back on Asgard, Thor entrusted the Tesseract to Heimdall, who used its power to restore the Rainbow Bridge, allowing Asgard to harness the Bifrost once again, before storing the Tesseract back in Odin's Vault. The following year, after managing to gain possession of the Reality Stone, the Asgardians found it unwise to keep two Infinity Stones in Odin's Vault and instead traveled to Knowhere, giving it to the Collector to store in his museum.
 about to steal the Space Stone]]
In 2017, Hela inspected the treasures in the vault and admitted the Tesseract was "not bad," but dismissed it in favor of the Eternal Flame. When Loki sought to enact Ragnarök, he passed by the Tesseract and secretly took it with him. Unaware of this, Thor assumed the Tesseract had been destroyed with the rest of Asgard. Thanos, who detected the Tesseract aboard the Statesman, intercepted it via the Sanctuary II. 

### Infinity War

#### Acquired by Thanos

 shattering the Tesseract and gaining the Space Stone]]
 
After slaughtering half of the remaining population, Thanos demanded the Tesseract. In an effort to stall him, Loki attempted to use the Tesseract as a distraction long enough for the Hulk to defeat Thanos. However, Thanos defeated the Hulk and crushed the Tesseract, to take possession of the Space Stone. After placing it in the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos used its power to halt one of Loki's daggers before teleporting himself and the Black Order away.
 uses the Space Stone to teleport from Knowhere]]
Thanos used the Space Stone to travel to Knowhere for the Reality Stone where he abducted Gamora. Bringing her back to the Sanctuary II, he revealed to her that he had captured Nebula and tortured her using the Power and Space Stones to force Gamora into revealing the Soul Stone's location, and used the Space Stone to travel to Vormir, taking her with him to collect it.
 uses the Space Stone on Titan]]
Thanos then made his way to his homeworld of Titan where he was confronted by Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, and some of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Thanos made liberal use of the Space Stone during the battle first using it to harmlessly funnel the kinetic energy of Stark's projectiles before sending it back at him. In an ultimate display of the Space Stone's power, he used it to send the Power Stone's energies to Titan's moon, ripping it to shreds before using the Space Stone to send the chunks hurtling towards the planet's surface.
 uses the Space Stone to teleport to Wakanda]]
Thanos later used it to collapse the remnants of a doorway to the Mirror Dimension into a singularity, which he then used as a weapon against Strange before using it with the Reality Stone to briefly alter Titan's terrain to defeat Strange. Upon defeating Stark, Thanos prepared to use all four of the Stones in his possession to execute him before Strange bartered the Time Stone for Stark's life. Thanos then used the Space Stone to teleport himself to Wakanda on Earth.
 uses the Space Stone to block Bruce Banner's assault]]
Upon arrival, he used the Space Stone to phase the Hulkbuster armor through Bruce Banner and into a rock wall as well as knock down Sam Wilson, before using it to vaporize all of James Rhodes's bullets and then create compression forces around the War Machine armor, grounding it. He then used the Space Stone to defend himself from Wanda Maximoff's stream of energy. After completing the Gauntlet, Thanos utilized all six Stones to enact the Snap, wiping out half of all life in the universe. He then used the Space Stone one last time to teleport himself to the Garden. 

### Destruction

Three weeks later, Thanos destroyed all the Infinity Stones, including the Space Stone by using the Stones' powers on itself. 

### Alternate Universe Versions

#### Seized by the TVA

 steals the Tesseract]]
 
In 2023, the Avengers initiated a Time Heist, where they used the Quantum Realm to time travel through to the Multiverse into alternate past timelines in order to acquire all six Infinity Stones and resurrect the victims of the Snap. Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner and Scott Lang were sent to an alternate 2012. However, Stark and Lang's attempt to acquire the Space Stone resulted in failure when an alternate Loki took possession of the Tesseract and used the Stone's power to create a wormhole and escape. 
 ]]
Arriving in the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, alternate Loki and the Tesseract were swiftly found and taken by the Time Variance Authority to their headquarters. The Tesseract was confiscated by the TVA and placed into evidence by a TVA worker named Casey, where it was held in a drawer with other Infinity Stones from alternate timelines, including other Space Stones. Later, Loki retrieved the Tesseract and attempted to use it to escape the TVA but set it down after he discovered that Infinity Stones had no power within the confines of the headquarters. 

#### Theft of the Space Stone

 steals the Tesseract from 1970]]
 
Tony Stark and Scott Lang retreated to their rendezvous point, informing Steve Rogers of their failure. Rogers inquired as to whether there was another place in time where they could safely steal the cube, only to be reminded by Lang that they each only had one Pym Particle left, which was only enough for the trip home. As they lamented in their current situation, Stark remembered that Howard Stark and Hank Pym both worked at Camp Lehigh in New Jersey on April 7, 1970, meaning that both the Tesseract and a supply of Pym Particles would be stored there. Stark successfully infiltrated the base with Rogers, and using his glasses to search for a gamma signature was able to locate the Tesseract, placing it within a discarded briefcase.
 ]]
After successfully transporting the alternate versions of the Stones to the main timeline, the Space Stone was extracted from the Tesseract and placed in the Nano Gauntlet. Using the Gauntlet, Banner harnessed the power of the six stones to restore the victims in the Blip, albeit losing the ability to use his right arm in the process.
 ]]
In the culmination of the Battle of Earth, the six Stones were used by Stark to kill an alternate Thanos and his army. Afterwards, Rogers was sent back into the Quantum Realm in order to put back the Infinity Stones to their timelines and journeyed to the alternate 1970 timeline to return the Space Stone, albeit without the Tesseract.

#### In Thanos' Possession

In an alternate 2018, Thanos acquired the Space Stone on his quest to acquire all six Stones. After he had travelled to Earth to acquire the Mind Stone, he became infected with a quantum virus and turned into a zombie. Despite this, he was able to retain the Stones that he had acquired. 

During the battle that followed, Thanos' infected mind had trouble wielding the power of the Stones at first, but he quickly adapted, killing Rocket and Groot and severely injuring Thor. Black Panther engaged Thanos while wielding the Mind Stone, but the Mad Titan was able to recover enough of his faculties to use the Space Stone to summon the Mind Stone directly to him, completing the Gauntlet. In an ultimate sacrifice, Black Panther sacrificed himself to throw Thanos into Wakanda's vibranium reactor core, killing the Mad Titan. 

However, the Infinity Stones were shattered in the process, releasing a hurricane of Infinity Energy that nearly killed Peter Parker and Scott Lang before they were saved by the Masters of the Mystic Arts. The Infinity Energy continued its destructive spread across the planet before finally being contained by Infinity Hulk in Paris.

## Capabilities

 ]]
 
As the Infinity Stone that represents and governs over space, the Space Stone grants the wielder absolute control over space itself. It is primarily used to open portals to other locations and can even allow interdimensional travel. As one of the six Infinity Stones, the Space Stone ranks as among the most powerful artifacts in the universe, and its power can be harnessed using devices able to contain its energy, including the Tesseract or the Infinity Gauntlet.

Within the Tesseract, it was the only artifact within Odin's Vault that managed to impress Hela, calling it "not bad." Like with all other Infinity Stones, it can only be used safely by beings of sufficient power, even when contained within the Tesseract. Prolonged physical contact is enough to not only melt through solid steel, but to quickly consume lesser beings, to the point of banishing them into the depths of space through a wormhole. Even through gloved hands, brief contact with the Tesseract is enough to painfully burn Nick Fury, and the Red Skull is forcibly transported to Vormir after holding it for an extended period of time.

Drawing power from space, the Space Stone's source of energy is so great that many consider its volumes of energy to be unlimited. Due to this, the Space Stone is capable of powering or repairing objects and artifacts of incredible power, such as the Rainbow Bridge. A single spark of its power was enough to create a small explosion, and its energy is able to be harnessed in advanced technology and weapons. Hydra was able to use the Space Stone's energy within the Tesseract to power advanced weapons of mass destruction including guns, tanks, and bombs that vaporized their targets, technology that would later be attempted to be replicated by S.H.I.E.L.D. in Phase 2. In Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S., Mar-Vell was able to harness the Tesseract's space-bending energy to create a Light-Speed Engine, capable of allowing spaceships to achieve interstellar travel without the use of the Universal Neural Teleportation Network.

As with the other Infinity Stones, the Space Stone also emits low levels of gamma radiation. When within the Tesseract, this property interfered with Selvig's methods of harnessing its energy source, and later allowed the Avengers to track its movements. Within the Nano Gauntlet, the combined radiation levels were dangerous enough to overwhelm an ordinary human like Tony Stark, and necessitated a being able to withstand gamma radiation to use without dying, like Bruce Banner in his Smart Hulk form.

The Space Stone is also able to enhance an individual with powerful abilities using its energy. Carol Danvers was enhanced after being exposed to the Stone's energy housed inside the Light-Speed Engine.

Notably, the Stone is also implied to have a form of limited sentience and degree of intelligence. Remarks by Erik Selvig refer to the Tesseract as a "she," even before his domination by the Mind Stone. He frequently describes the Stone as exhibiting and performing sentient emotion and acts, such as "misbehaving," and wanting to "show [Earth] ... a new universe." The Stone is able to reactivate machinery harnessing it independently under its own power, even when shut down by others. Curiously, when the Tesseract was brandished by an unworthy Red Skull, a man who greedily sought the Stones themselves, the Space Stone seemed to purposefully banish him to Vormir, where he would be doomed to an ironic fate, becoming the eternal keeper of the Soul Stone, but forever unable to wield it himself.

It is hypothesised by Clint Barton that the Tesseract is able to be manipulated remotely to an extent by outside forces from other points in space, as evidenced when Loki is able to induce the Tesseract to transport himself to its own location from Chitauri Space using machinery constructed by Erik Selvig.

After Thanos inserts it into the Infinity Gauntlet, it is shown that when wielded by someone who truly understands and masters its powers, the Stone's control over space can be used to gain a wide range of potent and dangerous capabilities that are not limited to simple teleportation to great effect in battle.

Thanos most often uses the Stone to create portals and wormholes to transport anywhere the Universe, and displays an incredible level of precision and control over their creation. By controlling portal size, he is able to individually select who or what is teleported alongside him, including entire groups of individuals, and his control is precise enough to even remove objects forcibly attached to his person, such as removing Stormbreaker impaled in his chest upon warping away.

Aside from the ability to create portals, Thanos has been shown to be able to expertly use the Space Stone to warp the fabric of space to generate powerful spatial pressure around his surroundings with a single gesture of the Gauntlet, able to make force fields strong enough to block bullets and even the energy of Scarlet Witch, or manipulate objects in a manner akin to telekinesis. Thanos was able to use the Stone to casually freeze Loki's knife mid-stab in an instant, effortlessly crush the guns on War Machine Armor: Mark IV and ground it, and crush the wings on the EXO-7 Falcon to knock down Sam Wilson. The Space Stone's spatial telekinesis is so strong that Thanos was even able to use it to telekinetically transport and pull the shattered fragments of Titan's moon across space at impossibly high speeds to rain down on the attacking Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy during the Battle of Titan.

Thanos further displays the ability to use the Stone for more specific feats in combat. This includes the ability to create powerful and devastating singularities capable of compressing and sucking in anything in their path. After shattering a gateway to the Mirror Dimension thrown by Doctor Strange, Thanos used the Stone to compress the gateway's fragments into a destructive black hole to throw back at the sorcerer. Thanos even shows the ability to phase and unphase objects out of space, rendering them incorporeal and corporeal again, such as when Thanos used the Stone to phase the attacking Bruce Banner out of space, causing him to fall through him harmlessly and into a cliff, before making him corporeal again while still within the cliff to trap him in solid stone.

Thanos displays the ability to combine the Space Stone with the other Stones to enhance its effects and make it capable of a larger variety of feats. Combined with the Power Stone, Thanos can even warp and manipulate energy, using the Gauntlet to absorb the explosive energy of Iron Man's missiles, and redirect it at the Avenger as a single concentrated beam of fiery energy. Together with the Reality Stone, Thanos can manipulate terrain at a grand scale, literally pulling the surface of Titan itself towards him in order to grab the mid-air Doctor Strange, and (presumably) trapping the attacking Black Widow in a cage of stone uprooted from the ground. 

When alongside all other Infinity Stones in a completed Gauntlet, the Stone is able to perform immensely powerful feats. In its most basic use, the Gauntlet can unleash a beam of white energy combining the power of all six Infinity Stones, which can be counteracted by a sufficiently powerful weapon like Stormbreaker. In their most powerful uses, the Stones are able to instantly kill/destroy and revive/recreate both lifeforms and inanimate objects with a simple snap of one's fingers, reducing affected beings/objects into dust or reconstituting them from thin air. This effect can be applied at a scale of the user's choosing, from only targeting a specific group to affecting life on a universal scale, able to randomly kill (and later revive) half of all life in the Universe. The sole exception to this are lifeforms sacrificed to the Soul Stone, who cannot be revived even with the power of all six Stones.

Together, the Stones are even able to destroy themselves by turning their energies upon each other, reducing them to nothing but atoms. These individual acts are enough to produce an energy surge of cosmic proportions, enough to be detected entire systems away. After changing his goals, the 2014 Thanos would further claim that the Stones were capable of both completely destroying and recreating the entire Universe in his utopic image, with an abundance of life that only knows the blessings he has given it, and nothing of the previous Universe destroyed to create it.

However, using all six Stones for such acts draws a great physical toll on the user's body and the weapon used to control them, severely burning both with the Stones' energy. It is enough to damage the Uru-made Infinity Gauntlet, kill an ordinary human like Iron Man, and scorch the arms and bodies of more powerful users like Hulk or Thanos into uselessness. Wounds sustained in this manner are near-permanent, and cannot be healed with the Stones' power.

## Trivia

*In the comics, the Space Gem was a purple Infinity Gem that increases the speed of its user and allows them to be teleported wherever they want. It was shattered alongside four of the other Infinity Gems, aside from the Time Stone, when the Illuminati tried to stop another universe from colliding with their own in the cosmic event of Secret Wars. After the restoration of the universe, the Infinity Gems were recreated, with the Space Gem now being blue.
