The Secret Invasion was a clandestine alien invasion of Earth by Skrulls, led by the radicalized Skrull General Gravik and his extremist resistance group, driven by an unfulfilled promise from Nick Fury to find the Skrulls a new home planet amidst the shadows of the Kree-Skrull War. The Skrulls began orchestrating several terrorist attacks as a precursor to their invasion, which later encompassed government impersonations and the creation of genetically augmented Super-Skrulls using stolen DNA from Earth's superheroes.

The invasion's primary objective was to trigger a nuclear war on Earth by manipulating world powers, notably the United States of America and Russia, into attacking each other. Notable events included the Unity Day Bombing, a failed maritime missile strike unto a United Nations airplane, and a botched assassination attempt on U.S. President James Ritson in England. The invasion was foiled by the collective forces of Fury, Talos, G'iah, and their allies, who managed to defeat Gravik, avert between the U.S. and Russia, and expose the Skrulls' covert infiltration of governments to the world. 

The aftermath of the invasion saw the implementation of the Anti-Alien Act, a legislation categorizing all extraterrestrial species as hostile entities. Fury, burdened with the protection of the outlawed Skrulls from global unrest, departed from Earth to help facilitate peaceful diplomatic resolutions between the Skrulls and the Kree.

## Background

 
Having lost their original home to the Kree, the Skrulls were offered sanctuary by Carol Danvers and Nick Fury on Earth. In 1997, Nick Fury made a deal with Talos and his Skrulls, promising to find them a new home if they helped him as agents of a secret spy network, gathering information and performing assassinations across the globe. The Skrulls agreed, believing Fury to be a figure of righteousness who would find them a new planet. Over the decades, however, Fury never followed through on his promise. Instead, he continued to use the Skrulls as tools for his own ambitions, rising up the ranks of S.H.I.E.L.D. and eventually becoming its next director.

In May 2018, Fury was killed in the Snap. Following the death of their planet's host, Talos called one million Skrulls to Earth. By the time Fury returned in the Blip in 2023, he immediately retreated to S.A.B.E.R. Space Station, and many Skrulls felt betrayed by his broken promises, growing increasingly frustrated. Gravik, who had grown up seeing Fury as a father figure, felt deeply abandoned by Fury's failure to deliver on his promise of a home. By 2026, the Skrull Council had infiltrated major world leaders, kicked Talos off the council due to his loyalty to Fury, and inducted Gravik as its newest member. Additionally, Gravik's own followers within his Skrull Resistance had infiltrated figures in positions of power across the world, including James Rhodes. 

## Invasion

### Terrorist Attacks

 
 following terrorist strikes]]
Violent actions by the Skrull Resistance within the past year were monitored by CIA agent Donald Prescod, who kept records on all of the events and analyzed them in a CIA safehouse in Moscow, Russia. These included an attack on Colombia by Argentina, an attack on the Philippines by Colombia, a mass shooting during in Munich, a freight train robbery in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a fire in New York City, an ambush on the French military, the destruction of two towers in London, and the hacking of the , and a plane crash that killed 197 people. Additionally, in July 2026, Prescod discovered a secret Skrull settlement operating out of an abandoned nuclear facility in southern Russia, and he reported his findings to the CIA. Prescod's Files 

### Attack on the Everett Ross Impersonator

 transforming]]
 
Trying to inform someone of his findings, Donald Prescod contacted Everett Ross to meet him at his safehouse. When Ross arrived, Prescod informed him of his findings, until he came to the realization that Ross was a Skrull. He fought the Ross Skrull, but was killed in the process. 

The Ross Skrull then left the CIA safehouse began being followed by Talos disguised as Russian man. The Ross Skrull then contacted Maria Hill for a safe extraction and she pointed him to Academica Metro Station. The Ross Skrull attempted to make his way there, but kept being chased by Talos. Attempting to evade him, the Ross Skrull went into the EMIII but jumped off the roof and killed himself. Hill held the unknown man at gunpoint who revealed himself to be Talos. Talos then went with Hill to meet Nick Fury and tell him of the Skrulls' plans. 

### Kidnapping of Nick Fury

 being kidnapped]]
 
Angry about the prospect of the invasion, Nick Fury went for a walk on the streets of Moscow. While walking, he was kidnapped by MI6 agents, who took him to a townhouse to meet Sonya Falsworth. Falsworth and Fury talked about the Skrull Resistance, with Fury offering to partner with Falsworth, an offer which Falsworth declined. Fury then left and made his way back to the safehouse. 

### Chase of G'iah

 talking to G'iah]]
 
With plans set to initiate a war between Russia and the United States of America, Gravik sent G'iah to pick up dirty bombs from a Skrull disguised as Vasily Poprishchin. G'iah arrived at Madman's Gallery and Nick Fury and Talos followed her in. Paying for the bombs G'iah left and Fury and Talos talked to the Poprishchin Skrull. The Skrull denied any knowledge of the bombs, but when Talos attacked him, he revealed himself to be a Skrull. Fury and Talos fought the Skrull and killed him. 

Leaving Madman's Gallery, G'iah started heading back to New Skrullos. Seeing someone who fit G'iah's description, Maria Hill started following her. Hill chased G'iah, but G'iah overpowered her and knocked Hill to the ground. Just before G'iah escaped, Talos appeared, holding her at gunpoint. Talos attempted to convince G'iah to surrender and hand the bombs over by telling her that her mother, Soren, would want her to. G'iah, shocked by the revelation that her mother was dead, still did not turn over the bombs and left. 

### Bombing of Vossoyedineniye Square

 ]]
 
With the bombs delivered, Gravik set out to execute his plan. He planned the bombing for Vossoyedineniye Square on Unity Day. Gravik lured Nick Fury, Maria Hill and Talos to Vossoyedineniye Square. Once there, he handed the bombs off to a couple Skrull agents. Fury followed Gravik while Hill and Talos followed two others. Hill and Talos found their marks, but discovered the bags were empty. Fury caught up to Gravik and held him at gunpoint, then Gravik detinated the bombs causing a massive explosion. 

The explosion caused massive panic, sending the square into chaos. Hill attempted to help injured people, but was approached by Gravik disguised as Fury, who shot her in the abdomen, causing her to bleed out and die. As Fury approached Gravik, a second explosion was set off, causing even more chaos and allowing Gravik to escape. Fury then made his way to Hill's body and grieved her death before being pulled away by Talos. 

Footage of Fury at the bombing was obtained by the Police of Russia and given to the United Nations. The Russian police also arrested a Skrull named Brogan disguised as Americans Against Russia member Martin Wallace, who kept exclaiming he was an American, to convince the Russian government that the bombing had been perpetrated by the United States. 

### Rescue of Brogan

 captured by the FSB]]
 
With Brogan in the custody of the FSB, Sonya Falsworth headed to the butcher shop where he was being held. Falsworth confirmed Brogan was a Skrull by cutting off his finger. She wanted to know the location of New Skrullos, however, when Brogan refused, Falsworth injected an Interrogation Serum in him, causing his blood to boil at a hundred and sixty degrees. Unable to resist the pain, Brogan confessed he did not know the location of New Skrullos, but did tell Falsworth about Gravik's plans for the Super Skrull Machine and the science leads, Rosa and Victor Dalton. 

While Falsworth was interrogating Brogan, Gravik planned his rescue. Gravik, Pagon, G'iah and Beto traveled to the FSB butcher shop. Gravik and Pagon broke in and took out the FSB agents while G'iah and Beto waited in the car. Just before the Skrull rescue team broke in, Falsworth escaped using a hatch in the floor. The Skrull rescue team broke in and rescued Brogan, leaving the butcher shop. 

On the way back to New Skrullos, Gravik noticed the FBS had raided his hideout. Believing Brogan gave up the location, Gravik told G'iah to keep driving and had her pull over in the forest. Gravik then gave Pagon a gun and had him take Brogan into the woods and execute him. 

### Rescue of UN-1

 ." "Well, why would they do something silly like that?" "Because at least one of Gravik's rebels has infiltrated Command.|Nick Fury and Sonya Falsworth|Betrayed}}
In order to push the Earth into World War III, Gravik sent Pagon, Beto and Zirksu to infultrate the Royal Navy and fire on the UN-1. Taking the forms of Connor Coombes, Thom Phipps and Dave Matailton, the Skrull team infultrated HMNB Clyde and took thier places abord the HMS Neptune. 

Having learned of this plan from G'iah, Nick Fury contacted Sonya Falsworth for information about Royal Naval operations. Falsworth sent Fury the information of Bob Fairbanks, pointing him to his address in Portsmouth, England. Armed with this information, Fury and Talos made their way to the Fairbanks Residence to prevent the HMS Neptune from firing on the United Nations-1. 

At the Fairbanks Residence, Fury and Talos broke in and defeated the house's guards. Once inside, Talos was taken hostage by the Bob Fairbanks Skrull. Needing to free him, Fury took Zachary Fairbanks hostage. When the Fairbanks Skrull set Talos free, Fury tied him to a chair to get him to abort the attack. When the Fairbanks Skrull refused, Talos shot him and called G'iah to get the abort code form the real Bob Fairbanks at New Skrullos. Once she had the code, she gave it to her father, who called off the attack just before it happened. 

### Attack on G'iah

 shot in the chest]]
 
Having giben the abort code to her father, Talos told G'iah to run and leave New Skrullos. Heading out on a motorcycle, G'iah reached a checkpoint where she was confronted by Gravik, who revealed that the attack on the UN-1 was a ploy to find the Skrull trator. Facing her, Gravik shot G'iah in the chest, and left her there to die. However, unknown to him, G'iah had used the Super Skrull Machine to give herself the powers of Extremis and survived the shot to the chest. 

### Ambush on President Ritson

 ]]
 
Trying again to enact World War III, Gravik planned an Ambush on President Ritson and planned to blame it on Russia. Raava, an undercover Skrull agent disguised as James Rhodes, notified Gravik when James Ritson left the airport in his motorcade. Gravik then launched his attack on the president of the United States of America disguised as Russian forces. 

Having slipped a Liquid Location Tracker into Raava's drink while visiting her, Nick Fury and Talos were able to follow her when Gravik launched his attack on the presidential motorcade. When they heard the explosions, Fury and Talos called for reinforcements and grabbed weapons and started fighting back against Gravik and the other Skrulls. 

The Special Air Service then arrived and reinforced Fury and Talos. Fury and Talos then made their way over to President Ritson and were able to sucsessfully free him from the car, however, Talos was shot in the process while trying to crack the window. Fury draged Ritson out and took him to his car. Talos, injured, was helped up by Gravik disguised as a Special Air Service agent. Gravik then changed back to his original form and stabbed Talos in the chest, killing him. Fury then shot Talos in the face, only to discover that Gravik had infused himself with Extremis. Fury then fled and took Ritson to King George VII Private Hospital. 

### Attack on Gravik

 slicing Beto's throat]]
 
Having killed Pagon, Gravik angered the other members of the Skrull Resistance. Beto and other members of the resistance planned to kill Gravik. When Gravik received a call from Raava, the rogue resistance members attacked him and attempted to kill him. However, Gravik was able to overpower them, and killed all the rogue Skrulls including Beto and Zirksu. 

### Attack on Varra

 and G'iah defending themselves]]
 
Having disobeyed a direct order from Gravik to kill Nick Fury, Varra had a hit placed on her. The Skrull Resistance tracked Varra to the Fury Residence, where she was having a funeral for Talos with G'iah. When Varra and G'iah went back inside the house, the resistance launched their attack. Although the attack was a surprise, Varra and G'iah were able to obtain weapons from a cache hidden in Varra's greenhouse, and fight the resistance. Varra and G'iah were able to kill all of the attackers, leaving Gravik unsucsessful. 

### Infiltration into King George VII Private Hospital

 points his gun at Nick Fury]]
 
On Gravik's orders, Raava showed President James Ritson footage of New Skrullos. Believing that the Russians were working with the Skrulls, Ritson ordered a nuclear strike agains New Skrullos. In order to prevent this, Nick Fury and Sonya Falsworth planned a mission to prevent the United States of America from launching an Atomic Bomb at Russia. 

To draw out the president, Falsworth called Raava and told her Fury was planning an attempt on Ritson's life. Raava reacted to this by moving Ritson to a higher floor and having the United States Secret Service spread out and lock down the King George VII Private Hospital. Fury and Falswroth then tranqualized the agents one-by-one until they cornered Raava and Ritson. Fury and Falsworth attempted to convince Ritson to delay the nuclear strike against Russia, but before he could make a decision, Raava grabbed Falsworth's gun and attempted to shoot Fury, however, Fury shot her first. Raava then turned back into a Skrull and Ritson called off the nuclear strike. 

### Duel at New Skrullos

 fighting Gravik]]
 
With Nick Fury and Sonya Falsworth on a mission to stop the nuclear strike against Russia, G'iah disguised herself as Fury and met Gravik at New Skrullos. Still acting as Fury, G'iah offered Gravik the Harvest in exchange for leaving Earth, but Gravik did not accept. Instead, believing that Fury was dying of radiation poisoning, Gravik put the Harvest into the Super Skrull Machine and activated the machine, giving him the powers of multiple superpowered beings. Unbknownst to him, the replicator gave G'iah the same powers, giving her the strength to fight Gravik. G'iah and Gravik dueled at New Skrullos, destroying multiple buildings, with G'iah eventually killing Gravik by blasting him through the chest with Carol Danvers' powers. 

## Aftermath

### Anti-Alien Sentiment

 addresses the United States of America]]
 
A strong anti-alien sentiment developed in the United States of America. A new Anti-Alien Act bill was submitted to the United States Congress for approval that designated all off-world born species as enemy combatants of the United States. When he returned home, James Ritson announced this on live television.

Additionally, the anti-alien rhetoric by President Ritson inspired anti-alien extremists to start killing those they suspected to be Skrulls, although their efforts got innocent people killed, most notably Pamela Lawton, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom who was simmed by a Skrull earlier on. Seeing this, Nick Fury accosted Ritson for his actions and the war he wanted to wage against all aliens.
