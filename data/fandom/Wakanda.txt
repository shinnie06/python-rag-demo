Wakanda, officially known as the Kingdom of Wakanda, is a country located in Africa. It is surrounded by mountain ranges and a thick jungle. It is one of the most technologically advanced nations on Earth, known for its rich deposits of the element vibranium. Wakanda is a constitutional monarchy, with King M'Baku as head of state.

## History

 

### Origins

 
 spreading around the land of Africa]]
2.5 million years ago, a meteorite made of the alien element vibranium landed in the heart of Africa, greatly affecting the surrounding flora. Centuries later, five tribes colonized the area and went to war over the metal, which they referred to as Isipho. One day, Bashenga was guided by a vision of Bast who led him towards a plant that had mutated as a result of the metal's radiation.

Upon ingesting the herb, Bashenga discovered he had been imbued with superhuman abilities and used them to unite the tribes as the first King of Wakanda and the first "Black Panther". Four of the tribes pledged their loyalty to Bashenga; the fifth, the Jabari Tribe, refused to pledge allegiance, and settled into the northern mountains to continue adhering to a more traditional and primitive way of life, while the rest of Wakanda continued to develop into a modernized rule. Bashenga's lineage would come to form a sixth pseudo tribe named the Golden Tribe, which included a line of his royal descendants that continued to survive into the modern day, thus establishing the Kingdom of Wakanda.

The broad areas of scope for the kingdom fell to the other tribes; the River Tribe fell responsible for dealing with agriculture and fishery; the Merchant Tribe with commerce and trade, the Border Tribe with border security as Wakanda's first line of defense, and the Mining Tribe was responsible for vibranium management. To ensure the safety of the kingdom, the War Dogs were instated as Wakanda's central intelligence service and secret police. Wakanda's military consisted of the Wakandan Royal Guard, although another branch included the Dora Milaje, an elite group of all-female warriors.

During the country's development, the Wakandans used the metal to develop technology that was far more highly advanced than any other in existence. To protect themselves from the chaos, including the European colonization of Africa, that was slowly consuming the rest of the world, they created a cloaking field that allowed them to hide in plain sight, while masquerading as a poor, undeveloped nation made up of mostly humble farmers and herders to the outside world. European explorers were later attracted by Wakanda's vibranium deposits, and they began expeditions to find Birnin Zana, which later was associated with the myth of following the arrival of the Spanish into . Later, Wakanda was marked as a "hot spot" for activities monitored by S.H.I.E.L.D. As such, Wakanda was displayed in the holographic maps used by the organization to oversee those activities. 

As time passed, Birnin Zana was established, which would later become the capital city of the Kingdom and the heart of the nation. This city was highly urbanized; Wakandan Maglev Trains were integrated for public transit and the transportation of other materials. At the center of the city is the Citadel, the Golden Tribe's royal palace. 

### Scattering of Artifacts

In 1260 BC, the former Wakandan Royal Guard Nkati stole numerous Wakandan artifacts and proceeded to carve out his own domain as the Lion. The disgraced former Dora Milaje Noni was tasked to bring the Lion back to Wakanda and end the threat he represented. Noni tracked his pirate fleet to Crete and snuck in as a captive. Eventually she succeeded in dueling and mortally wounding the Lion, though he chose to kill himself rather than be dragged back to Wakanda. He destroyed his own ship, sending his trove of Wakandan artifacts into the sea. Noni only managed to bring with her the Lion's mask back to Wakanda, where she was rewarded by reinstatement into the Dora. She declined, and sought to remain as a War Dog where she made it her mission to track down the remaining Wakandan artifacts. 

Decades later, the War Dog B'kai, undercover with the Greeks as Memnon, retrieved one such artifact at the end of the Trojan War, a necklace, from the neck of Helen of Troy. However, it had cost him the life of his own friend Achilles, who misconstrued his actions as a betrayal of their nine-year friendship, and B'Kai was forced to slay him to protect his mission. An aged Noni, now director of the War Dogs, welcomed B'kai back to the nation and allowed his wish to continue serving Wakanda overseas. 

Over 2,600 years later, in China 1400 AD, the War Dog agent Basha stole a dragon head statue with a vibranium tongue from a snowed-in village. He returned to Wakanda on an airship, unwittingly bringing with him a stowaway who sought to take back the statue. Jorani, a woman who found Basha in the snow weeks earlier, nursed him back to health. They began a relationship, until Basha proceeded with his mission and took the statue. However, Jorani was also an Iron Fist and the guardian of the village. She snuck into his airship and laid waste to War Dog personnel in their own headquarters while looking for the artifact. She and Basha eventually confronted each other, ensuing in a chase that led to the War Dog gallery where all retrieved artifacts were stored and displayed. Following a scuffle, and hearing out each side's motivations, Jorani used her Iron Fist power to break off the vibranium tongue and hand it back to Basha. At the end of the affair Basha sought to return her and the statue back to China with the help of his friend and superior officer Captain Ebo; the intrusion was covered up as a "training exercise" masterminded by Ebo, who allegedly donned the Iron Fist mask as a means of testing base security. 

In 1896 AD in Ethiopia, Prince Tafari and War Dog Kuda were on a mission to retrieve a vibranium ax while the city of Adwa was under siege from Italians. Kuda was ready to scrap the mission due to increased danger, but Tafari snuck in and retrieved the ax anyway. As they drove away in their vibranium-powered vehicle they were waylaid by an intruder who appeared from literally nowhere. This intruder sought the vibranium ax, and Tafari and Kuda battled them until they were forced to reveal their identity. She was a Black Panther, but from five hundred years in the future. She grabbed Tafari and Kuda's heads and showed what happened in her time: Earth was assaulted by massive insectoid aliens known as the Horde. The Golden City was reduced to ruin, and the future Panther and a handful of Dora Milaje were the only survivors. 

The future Panther used a Quantum Scanner to examine events in the past, connected to a portal that allowed her to physically time travel there. She saw the retrieval of the previous three artifacts as key moments in history, and the vibranium ax would be a perfect hinge point in undoing the bad future they were in. The ax needed to be put back where Tafari got it, so that a "forgotten son" of Wakanda would find the weapon. Before she could complete the mission herself, she was pulled back to the future, where the Horde have discovered the Wakandans' location. One by one the Dora fell until only the Panther was left, and she defended the portal to prevent the Horde from invading the earlier timeline, trusting her ancestors would be capable enough to finish the job. 

With much effort Tafari managed to return the ax back to its hiding spot. Tafari and Kuda returned to Wakanda empty-handed, but assured the Tribal Council that the ax must have been destroyed in the siege without telling them of the future Panther's visit. 

### T'Chaka's Rule

#### Early Years

In the 1980s, the reigning Wakandan monarch Azzuri had passed away. Prior to his death, Azzuri had passed down two royal rings to his two sons, Princes T'Chaka and N'Jobu. The Wakandan rulership, and the mantle of Black Panther, was handed down to T'Chaka, with his wife Ramonda instated as the Queen. They raised two children, T'Challa and Shuri. T'Chaka trained T'Challa throughout his childhood, preparing him to take over the mantle once he was of age. A failed attempt on T'Chaka's life was made by international criminal Ulysses Klaue, while T'Chaka was representing Wakanda at the in the Netherlands. 

#### N'Jobu's Betrayal

 
During T'Chaka's rulership, Prince N'Jobu became convinced that Wakanda's isolationist policy was completely wrong, as the Wakandans could help people of African descent around the world. N'Jobu decided that the only course of action was to initiate a global revolution. In 1992, N'Jobu tipped off Ulysses Klaue to incite his revolution; Klaue infiltrated the country with N'Jobu's intel, and managed to avoid all Wakandan security systems to steal a quarter ton of vibranium. Klaue triggered a bomb at the border, which killed numerous Wakandan citizens.

T'Chaka was quick to suspect N'Jobu's disloyalty to Wakanda, and tasked Zuri to spy on N'Jobu during an overseas War Dogs assignment in Oakland, California to confirm his suspicions. T'Chaka was forced to murder his brother after accusing him of treason when confronting him about his involvement in the attack. T'Chaka departed, leaving behind N'Jobu's son, N'Jadaka. 

#### Sokovia Accords

 
After a terrorist attack in Lagos claimed the lives of twenty-six people, eleven of the victims being relief aid workers from Wakanda, King T'Chaka was one of several international politicians who called for the United Nations to create a system of accountability. Sometime later, the United Nations passed the Sokovia Accords before arranging a formal ceremony at the Vienna International Centre in Austria. T'Chaka and his son T'Challa were among those in attendance. During the ceremony, as T'Chaka gave the keynote address, a bomb detonated and decimated the building, killing T'Chaka and twelve other people. After the attack, Wakanda became a United Nations country, but remained an isolated nation. 

#### T'Challa's Coronation

 returning home to Wakanda]]
As a result of T'Chaka's death, T'Challa was subsequently crowned as the new King of Wakanda, first retrieving Nakia from her current mission with Okoye. He then challenged M'Baku for the throne of Wakanda, as by tradition he must fight one of the warriors chosen for the kingdom's throne from the other tribes of Wakanda. While M'Baku was later defeated, his life was spared so he could continue aiding his own tribe in the mountains. T'Challa later took the Heart-Shaped Herb so he could meet with his ancestors including the late T'Chaka.

T'Challa's first tenure as King of Wakanda was very short-lived; his first course of action was to apprehend Ulysses Klaue during an overseas assignment in Busan. T'Challa worked with the CIA to apprehend Klaue, but since he was freed from CIA custody by his subordinates, T'Challa ultimately failed to deliver him to Wakandan justice. 

### Killmonger's Rule

#### Erik Killmonger's Coronation

 challenges T'Challa]]
After he learned from Zuri of the truth about his uncle N'Jobu, T'Challa was surprised to find that an outsider named Erik Killmonger had arrived in Wakanda with the corpse of Ulysses Klaue, who he had killed. Tensions stirred amongst the council, especially when W'Kabi, the Border Tribe's head of security, sided with Killmonger, feeling reverence towards him for killing Klaue; his parents were killed during Klaue's attack on the country. When forced to leave, Killmonger revealed his Wakandan heritage by announcing himself as N'Jadaka, the son of N'Jobu. Having exposed T'Chaka's role in N'Jobu's death, and now with a claim to the throne, N'Jadaka challenged T'Challa to the ritual combat.
 finally defeating T'Challa]]
Based on tradition, the two faced each other at the Warrior Falls for the ceremonial fight to earn the title of king. Upon being stripped of his powers however, T'Challa discovered that the military training and experience had made Killmonger a tough opponent for him to beat. Despite initially seeming like T'Challa would win, Killmonger later dealt some hard blows to T'Challa. Zuri attempted to stop the fight, but Killmonger murdered him with the Spear of Bashenga, recognizing his involvement in N'Jobu's death. Killmonger threw the injured T'Challa off Warrior Falls, winning the ceremonial combat and earning him the title of King of Wakanda. 

#### The Global Revolution

 is found and saved in Jabari Land]]
While Killmonger underwent the traditional rituals for a newly crowned Wakandan king, Killmonger rejected the idea of another King to be coronated after him. Inspired by a talk with his late father N'Jobu in the Ancestral Plane, Killmonger ordered the ancient herb gardens to be set on fire, as a first stride in purging remnants of traditional elements from Wakandan society. 

Killmonger was firmly seated in power with a new plan for a global revolution, in the name of ending the oppression of minor ethnic groups, specifically African-Americans, and arming them with vibranium weapons. Killmonger established contact with War Dogs stationed in New York, London and Hong Kong, intending to strike those three cities first. Killmonger's ultimate plan involved inspiring the oppressed into overthrowing world governments, which would escalate those countries into war, as his vision of a Wakandan Empire ruled supreme. 

Unbeknownst to Killmonger, T'Challa survived his fall, as he was recovered by fishermen from the Jabari Tribe in an unconscious state. He was transported to J'Abariland for recovery, and was given the final surviving Heart-Shaped Herb to recover as all other herbs were burned down by Killmonger. T'Challa woke up and requested for the Jabari to help him overthrow Killmonger. M'Baku set aside his political differences with T'Challa, agreeing to help him stop Killmonger's revolution. 

#### Battle of Mount Bashenga

 coming to the aid of Wakanda]]
As his dragon flyers took off one-by-one with their vibranium weapons, Erik Killmonger noticed one of the crafts on the ground burning. T'Challa emerged from the craft unscathed, as he and the Dora Milaje proceeded to face off against Killmonger and the Border Tribe with help from the Jabari Tribe.

During the battle, Killmonger had defeated the Dora Milaje and was about to tackle Shuri when T'Challa charged into him, knocking both of them into the vibranium mine that lay below Mount Bashenga. 

While in the mine, T'Challa and Killmonger fought each other on the tracks the Wakandan Maglev Train, where sonic-powered devices are used to nullify the effects of vibranium while they're being transported on the trains. Once T'Challa told Shuri to activate the Kimoyo Beads, the Black Panther Habits of T'Challa and Killmonger were able to be briefly disabled whenever a train passes, eventually allowing T'Challa to stab Killmonger in the chest with his own weapon.
 and Erik Killmonger watch the sunset]]
Knowing that he just lost the fight, Killmonger addressed his father and how he referred to Wakanda as the most beautiful place in the world. T'Challa then took Killmonger out of the mine to watch the sunset over Wakanda. T'Challa offered to help Killmonger by having him healed, but Killmonger declined, mentioning that he would rather die than get locked up. Killmonger then took the weapon out of his chest and died on the cliff, as T'Challa reclaimed his throne and kingdom. 

### T'Challa's Rule

#### Exposing Wakanda to the World

T'Challa had decided to open the advanced nation to the rest of the world and share its technology with them. Addressing the truth about Wakanda at the United Nations in Vienna, he announced the end of Wakanda's isolation and claimed the entire planet to be completely unified. He decided to purchase the apartment complex where T'Chaka killed N'Jobu and renovate it into the Wakandan International Outreach Centre, an embassy for Wakanda that Shuri and Nakia would run.

Because of their service in assisting T'Challa, M'Baku established relations with the rest of the country for the first time, thus allowing the Jabari Tribe to enter the Tribal Council. 

As a result, Wakanda opened its borders for foreigners to visit the country for various reasons, such as education. Todd Phelps took an opportunity and studied in Wakanda for several years. 

#### Sanctuary for Bucky Barnes

 
 
Weeks later, T'Challa invited Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes to his office in Wakanda, where he agreed to grant asylum to Bucky Barnes, promising rehabilitation and recovery from the Hydra programming implemented during his time in the Winter Soldier Program. However, Barnes would be put in cryo-sleep stasis until a cure could be formulated by the Wakandan Design Group, led by Shuri. Shuri also obtained a one-to-one digital reconstruction of Barnes' brain using a bio-scanner, which would be used to test potential cures. 

Months later, Shuri devised an algorithm that would reprogram his mind, flushing out the effect of the trigger words while still retaining the original content and context of those memories. She also believed the algorithm would improve Wakanda's own artificial intelligence technologies. 
 living in Wakanda]]
Barnes was later brought out of cryo-stasis by Shuri and began his recuperation in a remote Wakandan village. One morning, Barnes, who had been titled as the "White Wolf", woke to find himself being pestered by a trio of Wakandan children before Shuri arrived to help with his rehabilitation. Having had his mind repaired, Barnes began to work as a farmer within Wakanda to try and gain some normality back into his life and find his inner peace away from his life as an assassin for Hydra. 

#### Battle of Wakanda

 attack Wakanda]]
 
In 2018, the Avengers consisting of Steve Rogers, Black Widow, War Machine, Falcon, Bruce Banner, and Wanda Maximoff arrived in Wakanda and were greeted by T'Challa. They tasked Shuri with extracting the Mind Stone from Vision. Members of the Black Order and Outriders then invaded and the Avengers mounted a defense alongside T'Challa, Bucky Barnes, and the united forces of Dora Milaje, Jabari Tribe, and the Wakandan Royal Guard. Banner, unable to summon Hulk, fought in Stark's Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrived via the Bifrost Bridge and rallied the defenses. Proxima Midnight, Cull Obsidian and Corvus Glaive were killed and their army of Outriders destroyed.
 arrives in Wakanda]]
Unfortunately, at the same time, Thanos arrived in Wakanda, intent on personally retrieving the last Stone. The Avengers and their allies attempted to stop him from getting to Vision, but Thanos' near-omnipotence instantly overwhelmed them all. Alone with Maximoff, Vision told her that she had to kill him. At first, she refused out of love for Vision until he convinced her that it was the only way to stop Thanos. Maximoff then tearfully unleashed a stream of energy into the Stone. As he defeated the Avengers with complete ease, Thanos began to approach Vision and Maximoff but was held back by the latter, who issued a stream of energy. Vision managed to declare his love for Maximoff as she successfully cracked and shattered the Mind Stone, destroying it along with Vision in an explosion.
 takes the Mind Stone from Vision]]
Thanos briefly sympathized with Maximoff before he used the Time Stone to undo her actions and retrieved the Stone from Vision, deactivating him. After obtaining the Mind Stone, Thanos powered up, only to be interrupted by Thor, who unleashed the full might of his power and Stormbreaker upon Thanos in a last-minute attempt to stop him, violently stabbing him in the chest. Thor landed on the ground and walked towards him, pushing Stormbreaker into the latter's chest as deep as he could into Thanos, reminding him of the vow he made to Thanos for killing his brother.
 snaps the completed Infinity Gauntlet]]
Despite being badly wounded by Thor, Thanos remained unfazed and mocked Thor that he should have aimed for the head and activated the Infinity Gauntlet with a snap of his fingers before leaving Wakanda by a portal. Thanos' plan came to fruition as beings across the universe began to disintegrate, including in Wakanda as Barnes, Wilson, Maximoff, T'Challa, Groot, and some of the surviving Wakandan soldiers. Banner, M'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor were left on the Wakandan battlefield in defeat. 

### Ramonda's Temporary Rule

Following the loss of her two children, Ramonda took up as leader of Wakanda. Under her rule, Wakanda returned to its isolationism and protective forcefields were put in place. She met from time to time with other world governments, however, Wakanda became much more secluded. During this time, Okoye also took up leadership roles, working with the Avengers, and would meet via hologram calls, performing tasks for them. 

### T'Challa's Rule

#### Battle of Earth

 leads the Wakandan army]]
In 2023, as a result of the Blip, all Wakandan civilians, such as T'Challa and Shuri, were restored to life. All of Wakanda's armed forces, led by T'Challa, Okoye, and Shuri, were summoned by the Masters of the Mystic Arts and brought through a portal to aid the Avengers and their allies against an alternate Thanos and his army.
 
Afterwards, T'Challa, Okoye, and Shuri returned to Wakanda. There, T'Challa and Shuri reunited with Ramonda while watching the celebrations of families reunited in Birnin Zana.

The Wakandans then held a celebration in Birnin Zana's Citadel to celebrate T'Challa's return. 

#### Zombie Apocalypse

 
 with Infinity Gauntlet in Birnin Zana]]
In an alternate 2018, Thanos and his army, who had been infected by the quantum virus and became zombies, invaded Wakanda. A zombified Thanos stood by Birnin Zana wielding his nearly completed Infinity Gauntlet while the majority of Wakanda became infected. At the same time, T'Challa, Peter Parker, and Scott Lang arrived via Quadjet to broadcast the Mind Stone's frequency worldwide as a cure. However, a zombified Thanos waited in Wakanda for them to retrieve the Mind Stone. 

#### American-Wakandan War

 prepares to protect Wakanda]]
 
In an alternate 2008, Wakanda held a funeral ceremony for T'Challa. Afterwards, the Wakandan army consisting of the Dora Milaje, Wakandan Royal Guard, and the Border Tribe, led by Queen Ramonda and Erik Killmonger, prepared for war outside Birnin Zana against the Stark Liberator Drones sent by the United States Armed Forces.
 fights in the battle]]
King T'Chaka opened the Wakandan force-field allowing the drones to come inside, thus causing them to be unable to be of any use. However, unbeknownst to the Wakandans, Killmonger had the controls and turned the drones on, instigating a battle against them. The Wakandan army was victorious against the drones.
 as the new Black Panther]]
Afterwards, T'Chaka and Killmonger went to Mount Bashenga where T'Chaka proclaimed Killmonger to be the new Black Panther. Killmonger then took the Heart-Shaped Herb and took up residence in the Citadel. As Shuri led Pepper Potts and the Dora Milaje to the Citadel to apprehend Killmonger, Watcher arrived in the Citadel and took Killmonger out of the universe. When Shuri, Potts, and the Dora arrived inside they found that Killmonger disappeared.

## Trivia

*In the comics, Wakanda was founded by over seventeen distinct tribes; this was reduced to just five tribes for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
*In Captain America: Civil War, Wakanda is depicted as a small area around , a point where Uganda, Kenya, , and Ethiopia meet. Interestingly, this is the location of the , an area of land contested between Kenya and South Sudan. The Art of Black Panther, however, depicts it in the Valley, bordering Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda.
**The geography of Wakanda depicted thus far shows lush vegetation; in the introduction of Black Panther, this is shown to be part of its defenses - a shield that not only denies entry, but masks the developed country under a holographic illusion. However, the hologram is of a thick rainforest; this would situate Wakanda in Central Africa, i.e. bordering , rather than Kenya and Ethiopia, which are located in a mostly deserted section of the continent. 
*In Captain America: Civil War, T'Chaka speaks to T'Challa in , and it, therefore, appears to be their native tongue. However, while the Wakandan language is likely to be a (like Xhosa is) given its location, Xhosa is spoken in southern Africa, far from where Wakanda is said to be (however, the Xhosa were part of the Nguni migrations, which saw groups of Bantu speakers, head from Central Africa down south, with the Xhosa in particular once being near the Great Lakes).
*The Marvel Cinematic Universe differs from the main universe when it comes to religion in Wakanda;
**In the comics, Sekhmet is Bast's rival, even having a rival cult and not being part of Wakandan Pantheon.
**The Jabari tribe has a history of cults to ape gods, however, these have African origin: Ngi, a Yaoundé deity worshiped in west-central Africa and Ghekre is a Baoulé deity worshiped in West Africa.

## Behind the Scenes

*A vibranium mine in Wakanda was a location planned to appear in Avengers: Age of Ultron, but was ultimately scrapped.
