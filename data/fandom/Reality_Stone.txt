The Reality Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a singularity that predated the universe, representing the element of reality. Liquefied into a dark red fluid called the Aether, the Dark Elves and their leader Malekith intended to use it to revert the universe to its state of primordial darkness. In 2013, the Aether was absorbed into Jane Foster, triggering the Second Dark Elf Conflict. Following their defeat, the Aether was taken by the Asgardians and entrusted to the Collector.

During the Infinity War, the Aether was retrieved from the Collector's Museum in Knowhere and solidified by the Mad Titan Thanos, who put the Stone inside his Infinity Gauntlet and used it in conjunction with the other five stones to eliminate half of all life in the universe. Following the Snap, Thanos destroyed all six stones to prevent it from being undone.

In 2023, the Avengers conducted a Time Heist in order to resurrect the lives Thanos had claimed, with Thor and Rocket sent back in time to an alternate 2013 to retrieve the Aether from Foster. Following the Battle of Earth, where Iron Man used all six stones to kill Thanos and his army at the cost of his own life, Captain America time-traveled to the alternate 2013 and returned the Reality Stone, albeit in its solidified state.

## History

### Origin

 
 
The Reality Stone is a remnant of one of the six singularities which existed before the universe. After the universe came to be, the Big Bang forged the six singularities into elemental crystals, dubbed the Infinity Stones, hurtling across the universe. The red Reality Stone had the power to alter and warp the fabric of reality. 

### Owned by the Dark Elves

#### First Dark Elf Conflict

 attempts to use the Aether's power]]
 
Many thousands of years ago, Malekith, the king of the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim, discovered the Reality Stone. Through means unknown, he was able to liquify it, augmenting its properties so that it could convert matter into dark matter and absorb life force from host bodies. He intended to use the modified stone, now known as the "Aether", to revert the universe to its state of primordial darkness, a state of being in which the Dark Elves would resume their prior role as the most powerful beings in existence.
Malekith planned his campaign to coincide with Convergence, a cosmic event in which the Nine Realms of Yggdrasil are perfectly aligned through wormholes, in 2988 B.C.. The Dark Elves were opposed by the Asgardians under the command of their king Bor, leading to a protracted war that gradually turned against the Dark Elves' favor.
With the Asgardians forcing the Dark Elves back to Svartalfheim for a final battle, Malekith sought to use the power of the Aether, now encased in a large Chamber, while the battle waned around him.
 ]]
The Asgardians were able to take the Aether before its destructive power could be unleashed, however, using the Bifrost Bridge to snatch it from Malekith's possession, ultimately deciding the battle, and the war.

Believing the Dark Elf threat neutralized forever, Bor saw that the Aether was buried on a distant world, intending that no other tyrant attempt to harness the weapon's fearsome power again. His gambit worked, with the Aether fading from history for 5,000 years. 

#### The Second Attempt

 discovers the Aether]]
 
In November 2013, near the beginning of the Convergence, a portal opened up to where the Aether was located; Jane Foster happened to walk through this portal and, through curiosity, made contact with it, causing it to become active and infest Foster's body, using her as a host. After having been knocked out due to the ancient force having infested itself into her body, the Dark Elves awoke from their suspended animation aboard the Ark ship and started to search for the Aether.
 is possessed by the Aether]]
After arriving back on Earth, Foster exhibited an immensely powerful energy projection when being touched on the arm, and was taken to Asgard by Thor where the Aether was discovered by Odin. During her time on Asgard, Foster and Thor learned about the Aether's origin and discovered it was an Infinity Stone used as the Dark Elves' chief weapon for thousands of years prior to its theft by the Asgardians.
 absorbs the Aether]]
Sensing the Aether's presence on Asgard, Malekith's lieutenant, Algrim, became the last of the Kursed warriors, allowing himself to be captured by the Einherjar. While Malekith and the Dark Elves invaded the city, Algrim initiated a chaotic uprising in the Asgardian Dungeons, having released dozens of prisoners after his transformation into the Kurse. Frigga defended Jane Foster from the Dark Elves, going as far as to challenge the Dark Elf leader and almost killing him, despite her being intercepted and murdered by Algrim. Through Frigga's sacrifice, Malekith and his army left before he could obtain the Aether.
 unleashes the Aether upon the Nine Realms]]
Later though, when access to the Bifrost Bridge had been restricted, Thor, with a dying Foster, got Loki to take them through a hidden passageway to Svartalfheim. After getting there, they confronted Malekith and through various circumstances, the Dark Elf drew the Aether from Foster and into himself and left the planet. Both parties then arrived on Earth, where Malekith used the Aether to battle Thor across worlds during the Convergence, which resulted in Malekith's destruction. 

### Owned by the Collector

 is given to the Collector]]
 
Afterward, the Asgardians were able to contain the Aether. Sif and Volstagg brought the Aether to the Collector in his museum on Knowhere for safekeeping. In 2014, the Aether was being exhibited in the museum during the Guardians of the Galaxy's visit. Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy | All the Facts | Disney+ Deets In May 2015, Thor had a vision of the Infinity Stones, seeing the Aether solidifying into the Reality Stone. 

### Infinity War

#### Acquired by Thanos

 ]]
 
In May 2018, Thanos traveled to Knowhere and took the Aether from the Collector, solidifying it into the Reality Stone and adding it into the Infinity Gauntlet. He used it to create an illusion of himself and the Collector in order to trap the Guardians of the Galaxy and then briefly rendered himself invisible while talking to Gamora. He then revealed himself and used the Stone to turn Drax and Mantis into pieces of matter and Peter Quill's blast from his blasters into bubbles.
 revealing the past beauty of Titan]]
Later on Vormir, Thanos used the Reality Stone to turn Gamora's dagger into bubbles so he could thwart her attempt to kill herself. After arriving on Titan, he used the Reality Stone to show Doctor Strange how Titan once was before the population died, revealing Titan's prosperous population and beauty. In his duel against Iron Man, he used the Stone to transform a large chunk of debris that he destroyed into swarms of black crystals and in his duel with Strange, used the Stone to negate his dimensional gate before finally ending the fight by combining the Stone with the Space Stone to pull Strange to him.
 obtains all the Infinity Stones]]
Upon arriving in Wakanda, Thanos used the Reality Stone to imprison Natasha Romanoff in a rock chamber and to initiate the Snap, wiping out half of all life in the universe. 

#### Destruction

Thanos then retreated to Planet 0259-S and three weeks later, used the Stones to destroy themselves, resulting in the Reality Stone's destruction. 

### Alternate Universe Versions

#### Theft of the Reality Stone

 with the extracted Aether]]
 
In 2023, the Avengers initiated a Time Heist, where they used the Quantum Realm to time travel through the Multiverse to acquire all six Infinity Stones from alternate timelines to resurrect the victims of the Snap. Arriving in an alternate 2013 timeline, Thor and Rocket traveled to Asgard where they were tasked with extracting the Aether from an alternate Jane Foster during her brief stay at the Royal Palace of Valaskjalf. After Rocket successfully extracted the Aether, he and Thor used the Quantum Realm to return to their timeline.
 ]]
After successfully transporting the alternate versions of the Stones to the prime timeline, the Aether was solidified into the Reality Stone and placed in the Nano Gauntlet. Using the Gauntlet, Bruce Banner harnessed the power of the Stones, enacting the Blip, albeit losing the ability to use his right arm.
 ]]
Tony Stark used the combined power of the Stones to kill an alternate Thanos and his army. Afterwards, Steve Rogers used the Quantum Realm to enter the alternate 2013 timeline in order to return the Reality Stone, albeit in its solidified state, to Asgard. 

#### Seized by the TVA

 ]]
While capturing Variants and pruning timelines, the Time Variance Authority seized Infinity Stones from alternate timelines, including numerous Reality Stones. 

#### Age of Ultron Universe

In an alternate 2015, Thanos gained possession of the Reality Stone, placing it in the Infinity Gauntlet. When he arrived on Earth, he was killed by Ultron. Ultron took the Reality Stone, as well as the other Infinity Stones, from the Gauntlet and placed them into his armor. He then used the Reality Stone to recreate an increased amount of Ultron Sentries, a spaceship, and a cape for himself. Later, Ultron used the Stone in his fight against Watcher.

## Capabilities

 
As the Infinity Stone that represents and governs over reality, the Reality Stone granted its user absolute control over the fabric of reality itself, as one of the most powerful artifacts in existence. Like all Infinity Stones, it can only be wielded by beings of sufficient power, and also emits gamma radiation. Within the Nano Gauntlet, the combined radiation levels of the Stones were dangerous enough to overwhelm an ordinary human like Tony Stark, and necessitated a being able to withstand gamma radiation to use without dying, like Bruce Banner in his Smart Hulk form.

When inserted into the Infinity Gauntlet in its Stone form and wielded by Thanos, a user who fully understands and has mastered its capabilities, the Stone is able to warp reality to a greater extent than previously perceived, with Thanos demonstrating numerous powerful capabilities that he effectively employed.

From the Reality Stone, Thanos acquired the power to create highly elaborate physical simulations and illusions of false realities. Prior to the Ambush in Knowhere, Thanos used the Stone to create an illusion of himself interrogating the Collector in deserted Knowhere, in order to fool the approaching Guardians of the Galaxy, obfuscating the fact that the colony had already been sacked and burnt. The false reality was so convincing that the false Thanos could physically interact with others, even fighting and being killed by Gamora, whilst the real Thanos remained invisible as an observer. Again, prior to the Battle of Titan, Thanos used the Reality Stone to alter the landscape of Titan and show Doctor Strange how the planet had looked in its prime, before it became a desolate wasteland.

 transmutes Star-Lord's blaster into bubbles]]
The Reality Stone also gave Thanos the power to warp and transmute matter into anything he wished, using this ability to transfigure objects and even living organisms around him offensively. With a single blast from the Stone, Thanos easily incapacitated Guardians Drax and Mantis by temporarily warping their physical bodies, splitting Drax's body into pieces and turning Mantis into still-conscious strips of flesh. In both cases, these transformations were non-lethal and temporary, with Drax and Mantis automatically restoring themselves after Thanos departed the area. During the Battle of Titan, Thanos used the Reality Stone's transmutation powers effectively in combat, transmuting a field of ship wreckage into a swarm of bats to attack Iron Man.

Thanos was also able to use this ability discreetly. When Star-Lord reluctantly attempted to execute his teammate and lover, Gamora, to prevent her capture by Thanos, the Titan silently transmuted Star-Lord's Quad Blasters to harmlessly fire bubbles, before dissolving the weapon itself into bubbles. Thanos would later do the same to Gamora's dagger on Vormir to prevent her from committing suicide.

The Reality Stone can be used in conjunction with the other Stones to expand its effects. Combined with the Space Stone, Thanos was able to manipulate terrain at a grand scale, literally pulling the surface of Titan itself towards him to pull a flying Doctor Strange into his hand, and (presumably) manipulating the ground to spawn a cage of stone pillars to trap Black Widow in the Battle of Wakanda. In conjunction with the Soul and Time Stones, Thanos could heal fatal injuries he had sustained (discounting those caused by the Stones themselves), managing to fully heal the near-fatal wound caused by Stormbreaker as he teleported away with the Space Stone.

When alongside all other Infinity Stones in a completed Gauntlet, the Stone is able to perform immensely powerful feats. In its most basic use, the Gauntlet can unleash a beam of white energy combining the power of all six Infinity Stones, which can be counteracted by a sufficiently powerful weapon like Stormbreaker. In their most powerful uses, the Stones are able to instantly kill/destroy and revive/recreate both lifeforms and inanimate objects with a simple snap of one's fingers, reducing affected beings/objects into dust or reconstituting them from thin air. This effect can be applied at a scale of the user's choosing, from only targeting a specific group to affecting life on a universal scale, able to randomly kill (and later revive) half of all life in the Universe. The sole exception to this are lifeforms sacrificed to the Soul Stone, who cannot be revived even with the power of all six Stones.

Together, the Stones are even able to destroy themselves by turning their energies upon each other, reducing them to nothing but atoms. These individual acts are enough to produce an energy surge of cosmic proportions, enough to be detected entire systems away. After changing his goals, the 2014 Thanos would further claim that the Stones are capable of both completely destroying and recreating the entire Universe in his utopic image, with an abundance of life that only knows the blessings he has given it, and nothing of the previous Universe destroyed to create it.

However, using all six Stones for such acts draws a great physical toll on the user's body and the weapon used to control them, severely burning both with the Stones' energy. It is enough to damage the Uru-made Infinity Gauntlet, kill an ordinary human like Iron Man, and scorch the arms and bodies of more powerful users like Hulk or Thanos into uselessness. Wounds sustained in this manner are near-permanent, and cannot be healed with the Stones' power.

### Aether

 
 
Unlike the other Infinity Stones, the Reality Stone is able to take on other forms besides its original solid shape. When held by the Dark Elves, Malekith was able to wield the Reality Stone in a fluid and everchanging form known as the Aether, which is wielded by bonding to a host body and drawing strength from their life force, akin to a living infection within their body. As such, when bonded to an ordinary human, this process will inevitably kill them, as evidenced by Jane Foster.

As the Aether, the Stone's primary purpose is the ability to convert matter into dark matter. When provided a means of spreading its influence across great distances, such as the portals of the Convergence, it is able to transform reality on a universal scale, intended to be used by Malekith to convert the entire Universe into dark matter.

The Aether displays a certain degree of independence and almost sentience through its fluid form. Even when within a host body unable to use its power, the Aether is able to independently lash out at perceived threats to its host body by unleashing shockwaves of red energy powerful enough to throw Asgardians, identified by Thor as the Aether protecting itself. When within Jane Foster, the Aether is even able to show her visions of potential future events, such as Asgard converted into dark matter, or Malekith using the Convergence from Earth to spread the Aether and convert the Nine Realms into dark matter, allowing her to relay Malekith's plan and location to Thor.

When in its Aether form, only Malekith displayed the ability to sense the Reality Stone's power, the Dark Elves automatically reawakening from a 5,000 year hibernation upon the Aether's rediscovery. Additionally, only Malekith was able to safely remove it from other bodies at will and absorb it into himself. Malekith was able to draw the Infinity Stone out of Jane Foster with a gesture, where Asgardian technology was entirely unable to remove the Stone from her. However, Rocket Raccoon was able to design a container able to artificially draw the Aether from Jane's body through its probes.

Outside a host body, the Aether is still nearly indestructible, able to withstand blows and direct lightning blasts from Mjølnir, which only briefly reduce its form into solid crystals, before reconstituting into its fluid form.
 gains black eyes from the Aether]]
When bonded to a strong host such as Malekith, the Aether greatly enhances the host's physical strength and durability, enough for Malekith to fight Thor on a reasonably even basis. Malekith was capable of wielding the Aether directly in combat, able to strike out at Thor with tendrils and masses of Aether fluid, regenerate lost limbs from Aether energy, and even grow in physical size to roughly three times Thor's height.

Malekith is able to use the Aether to its fullest extent during the Convergence, unleashing it in a tornado of red energy to spread its influence across the Nine Realms. In this state, Malekith physically sends the Aether through the Convergence's portals using tendrils of its fluid. Physical contact with its tendrils is enough to instantly convert even the Bifrost Bridge into dark matter. 

## Trivia

*In the comics, the Collector owned the Reality Gem before Thanos took it from him.
*The large structure which contained the Aether is called the Chamber. 
*In Guardians of the Galaxy the Reality Stone (as Aether) appeared in a hologram displayed by the Collector; however, it is also visible inside a box in the Collector's Museum before that scene. 
*The Reality Stone and the Time Stone were the only Stones that Thanos got in the exact order they were introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Avengers: Infinity War. The Reality Stone was the third Stone to be introduced (after the Space Stone and the Mind Stone) and the third Stone that Thanos got (after the Power Stone and the Space Stone). The Time Stone was the fifth Stone to be introduced (after the Space Stone, the Mind Stone, the Reality Stone and the Power Stone) and the fifth Stone that Thanos got (after the Power Stone, the Space Stone, the Reality Stone and the Soul Stone).
