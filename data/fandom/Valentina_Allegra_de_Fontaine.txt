Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine is a noblewoman, chairwoman of O.X.E. and the Director of the CIA. Interested in privatizing global security and gaining power within the United States government, de Fontaine sought out to recruit or create powerful individuals to serve as her enforcers. De Fontaine personally recruited John Walker, who had lost his position as Captain America, and Yelena Belova, who was feeling lost after losing her sister, among others. When political tensions arose between the United States and Wakanda, with the U.S. wishing to obtain vibranium for themselves, de Fontaine assigned her ex-husband and subordinate Everett Ross, who strongly opposed any offensive actions against Wakanda, to work with her. However, de Fontaine knew Ross would betray them and arrested him for committing treason after she gained evidence of him giving classified intelligence to Wakanda.

When facing impeachment due to her connection to illegal black ops projects, de Fontaine ordered her enforcers to eliminate all traces of O.X.E., including Project Sentry. However, learning she sent them to kill each other, her agents turned against her and became the Thunderbolts after unintentionally reactivating Bob Reynolds. Seeing Reynolds as proof of Project Sentry’s success, de Fontaine attempted to control him as her personal weapon, but his dark alter ego, the Void, turned against her and threatened to engulf New York City in his darkness. After witnessing the Thunderbolts save civilians and desperate to protect her reputation, she publicly rebranded them as the New Avengers, although the team still had enough leverage on de Fontaine to keep her in check.

## Biography

 

### Early Life

#### Murder of her Father

 
Valentina Allegra de Fontaine was an Italian Contessa. When she was a little girl, she inadvertently led her father's killer to him during the in Italy, witnessing the murder, an event that would prompt her belief that there were only bad guys and worse guys in the world. 

#### Marriage to Everett Ross

In her adulthood, de Fontaine moved to the United States and married Everett Ross, although they eventually got divorced. De Fontaine founded O.X.E., a company that served as a front for various black ops project, which she needed to keep a secret. In 2016, in the aftermath of the Avengers Civil War, de Fontaine purchased Avengers Tower from Tony Stark, who moved all of its equipment to the Avengers Compound. 

#### Project Sentry

While leading O.X.E., de Fontaine became interested in creating superpowered individuals to capitalize on the Avengers' absence, and launched Project Sentry. O.X.E. experimented on numerous test subjects under de Fontaine's orders to create a potential superpowered asset, one of them being Bob Reynolds, although the project was deemed a failure after the majority of test subjects died. When de Fontaine was appointed as the Director of the CIA, she publicly left a leading position at O.X.E. and served only as a consultant, while secretly retaining control over the company's operations. 

### Finding Recruits

#### Recruiting Taskmaster and Ghost

Following the Blip, de Fontaine began searching for special individuals to recruit to undertake shadow ops missions for O.X.E. De Fontaine recruited Antonia Dreykov, a former Red Room operative, codenamed Taskmaster, with the ability to perfectly mimic the fighting techniques of other individuals. De Fontaine also recruited the former S.H.I.E.L.D. operative turned criminal Ava Starr, also known as Ghost, who had the ability to become invisible and intangible. De Fontaine supplied both of her recruits with new suits and sent them on various missions, mainly assassinating high valued targets. 

#### Meeting with John Walker

 ]]
 
In 2024, following John Walker being stripped of his title as Captain America and military rank due to him murdering Nico, a foreign national and member of the Flag Smashers who was surrendering, de Fontaine met with him and his wife, Olivia Walker, at a bench outside the main courtroom in the United States Capitol. She introduced herself to the two, noting the name that she would prefer them to address her by, before she then awkwardly sat down between them.
 's death]]
Sitting down, de Fontaine had told Walker that, if she had been in the same position that he had been in, she would have killed Nico too, as he had been responsible for the death of Battlestar, while saying the only reason Walker was being punished was the government had to uphold their laws. She explained that she was aware Walker took the Super Soldier Serum before fighting the Flag Smashers, that he no longer possessed his shield, since Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes had managed to subdue him and then reclaimed it, and that taking that serum made him valuable to certain people, whom de Fontaine was connected to.
 ]]
As Walker's wife tried to ask who de Fontaine was, she continued speaking to Walker and gave his wife a blank business card. She told Walker that his decision to take the serum was the best decision he had ever made, along with choosing to marry Olivia. She told Walker that the next best decision he would make would be to pick up the phone when she called him. She noted that the shield did not belong to the government before leaving. 

#### Creating U.S. Agent

 's new suit]]
 
With the Flag Smashers defeated, de Fontaine reunited with John Walker, after he had helped in the fight. While Walker put on his uniform, de Fontaine talked with Olivia Walker about all but one of the remaining Flag Smashers being killed while being transported to the Raft, saying that Helmut Zemo, who intended to destroy all super soldiers, had gotten the last laugh after all. Walker then stepped into the room in a new version of his suit, now all-black. As de Fontaine complimented the suit, she told the Walkers that the world was changing and that people did not need a Captain America, giving Walker the new name of "U.S. Agent" before leaving. 

#### Meeting with Yelena Belova

 ]]
 
Contessa de Fontaine met Yelena Belova, a trained assassin and spy and the surrogate sister of Natasha Romanoff. In December 2024, de Fontaine was contacted by Eleanor Bishop to assassinate Clint Barton. De Fontaine visited Romanoff's grave to speak with Belova, who was paying her respects there, making her presence known by blowing into a handkerchief and joking that she was "allergic to the Midwest."
 a target]]
Belova called de Fontaine desperate for coming to her while she was on holiday and asked for a raise. De Fontaine joked that she wanted one too, before telling Belova that she had a new assignment for her. Handing her a tablet, de Fontaine told Belova that her target was Barton and claimed that he was the one responsible for Romanoff's death. 

### Director of the CIA

#### Anti-Wakandan Sentiments

 
 
In May 2025, hearing of an event regarding Wakandans and the FBI, de Fontaine went to Cambridge, Massachusetts and requested help from Everett Ross. Upon arriving, she observed a pair of Kimoyo Beads on the ground and secretly rigged it so she could know who was using it. When Ross arrived, she complimented him on his fitness and proceeded to speak with the FBI agents.
 to drive her]]
The Special Agent in Charge approached de Fontaine, who was rude to him. He then said he believed it was a car crash, but could not find the cars. The SAC said that the cars must have been taken and dropped into the river, which de Fontaine believed was outrageous. Afterwards, she asked Ross if he could give her a ride back to George Bush Center for Intelligence as she wanted to speak about their marriage. 

#### Meeting in Langley

 ' "call"]]
 
De Fontaine and Everett Ross then arrived in Langley, and de Fontaine expressed her confusion as to how the Wakandans were able to deduce who built the Vibranium Detector, as the information was highly classified. De Fontaine then heard a ringing from Ross' pocket. Addressing her as director, Ross told her he would have to answer it. De Fontaine told him he could answer it without the formalities. De Fontaine expressed surprise when she overheard Ross address his caller as his partner, and then left his car to enter the CIA headquarters.
 at a meeting]]
De Fontaine and Everett Ross talked with the U.S. State Secretary. The secretary brought up that the President wished for the CIA to commence destabilization efforts on Wakanda. De Fontaine asked Ross what he thought. Ross claimed that his sources told him there was another enemy at play. Ross asked for time to investigate, or they could find themselves at war. The secretary asked de Fontaine for her opinion, and she simply said Ross was the expert. Ross repeated himself that it would be a mistake to attack Wakanda. 

#### Confronting Her Ex-Husband

 about lying]]
 
At Everett Ross' House, de Fontaine greeted Ross and showed him a news report about the death of Ramonda. As Ross expressed his shock at this news, de Fontaine pondered what other secrets the Wakandans kept from him. He attempted to bluff to her he had no unsanctioned contact with Wakanda, but de Fontaine revealed she had Shuri's Kimoyo Beads bugged before he arrived at the crime scene and knew about his contact with Ramonda.
 ]]
Ross defended his decision, stating that Wakandans are good people, before asking what the United States of America would do if they were the only ones with had access to vibranium. de Fontaine informed him that was exactly what she wanted, in fact, she dreamed of it. Ross tried to reason with de Fontaine, but she coldly refused to listen and placed him under arrest for his act of treason against the United States.

#### Announcing the New Avengers

 
After Void's actions were undone by the Thunderbolts, their attention shifted towards Valentina. She initially acted scared and she tried to run away behind some debris, but it was actually all a ruse by her. In order to save face, she decided to trick the Thunderbolts into the same press conference she had prepared for Sentry, to announce them as the New Avengers, taking all the credit. While this worked, it also meant her ex-agents now owned her.

In the following months, Valentina provided the New Avengers with a rebranded Watchtower, alongside new equipment and even their own merchandise.
