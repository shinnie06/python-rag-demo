## Synopsis

Set against the vibrant backdrop of a 1960s-inspired, retro-futuristic world, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" introduces Marvel's First Family—Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm/Invisible Woman (Vanessa Kirby), Johnny Storm/Human Torch (Joseph Quinn), and Ben Grimm/The Thing (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) as they face their most daunting challenge yet. Forced to balance their roles as heroes with the strength of their family bond, they must defend Earth from a ravenous space god called Galactus (Ralph Ineson) and his enigmatic Herald, Silver Surfer (Julia Garner). And if Galactus' plan to devour the entire planet and everyone on it weren't bad enough, it suddenly gets very personal. 

## Plot

 appear on The Ted Gilbert Show]]
In an alternate 1960s, Dr. Reed Richards and his wife, Dr. Sue Storm, celebrate a positive pregnancy test. Soon after, television host Ted Gilbert presents a special broadcast marking the fourth anniversary of the world-famous Fantastic Four. The team consists of Richards, Storm, her brother Johnny, and Richards' best friend Ben Grimm. They had gained their powers after being exposed to Cosmic Radiation during a space expedition aboard the Excelsior. Richards became elastic, Sue could manipulate invisible energy, Johnny gained pyrokinesis, and Grimm developed super strength along with an indestructible rock-like hide. Setting up residence at the Baxter Building, they faced villains such as Giganto, Harvey "Mole Man" Elder, the Mad Thinker, and Red Ghost and his Super-Apes — together, as a family.
 congratulates Sue Storm]]
As her pregnancy is announced to the public and the rest of the team at Sunday dinner, Sue takes maternity leave from the Future Foundation, the organization responsible for global demilitarization and peace, while people speculate whether her child will have superpowers. In his laboratory, with robot assistant H.E.R.B.I.E., Richards reviews old spacesuit designs brought by Johnny. As a new deep space transmission is recorded, Richards' tests the successful teleportation of organic matter, though the process requires immense amounts of energy. When Johnny resets a breaker while Richards runs diagnostics on the unborn child, he studies the recording, longing for another chance at space travel.
 confronts the Silver Surfer]]
Grimm returns from speaking with local schoolteacher and love interest Rachel Rozman and joins the family on the balcony before dinner. They watch as the sky turns bright orange and an alien woman on a surfboard descends into Times Square. The "Silver Surfer" heralds the advent of Galactus, an omnipotent cosmic being who seeks planets to devour, and Earth is next. Johnny follows her but is shaken off after she gives him a foreign proverb. At the Baxter Building, the team traces Silver Surfer's past visits and discovers that each of the five planets she targeted for Galactus has since been destroyed. Intrigued, Johnny reviews old transmissions and realizes that her language is spoken in all of them.
 meet Galactus]]
Publicly announcing their mission to confront Galactus, the Fantastic Four and H.E.R.B.I.E. depart aboard the Excelsior. They lock onto the Faster-than-Light Engine and reach a planet that collapses into Galactus' ship. Inside, the Silver Surfer tells Johnny her proverb was a blessing: "Die with yours." Galactus demands the unborn child, who holds limitless power and must inherit the eternal hunger that Galactus suffers. The team refuses and escapes, pursued by Silver Surfer through a wormhole. They emerge in a neutron star's accretion disk, where Richards plans to trap Silver Surfer past the event horizon and use the neutron star's gravity to propel the Excelsior out. The plan works, but Sue goes into labor as triggered by Galactus. Baby Franklin Richards is delivered on board.
 return to Earth]]
Back on Earth, a shaken Reed announces at the lobby of the Baxter Building that Galactus demanded Franklin, and that they refused — even if it means Earth's destruction. At a loss regarding humanity's safety, he applies ' , using the principle that a small, well-placed force can move a much larger load — metaphorically, solving a smaller problem to begin shifting the larger chain of problems. Johnny works on translating more transmissions, looking for their "lever." Public opinion turns against the Fantastic Four, with many urging them to give up Franklin. Sue is angered that Reed even considers their arguments, but Reed insists he always plans for the worst to hurt his enemies. Sue retorts that his habits hurt her as well, despite his intentions.
 bargains with Silver Surfer]]
Sue addresses the protestors outside, recalling how her father fought to keep their family together after a gruesome car crash. She vows that, like her late mother did for her, the Fantastic Four will "move heaven and Earth" to protect humanity. Reed then realizes that his Teleportation Bridge could move Earth itself. The Future Foundation rallies international cooperation to build synchronized large-scale bridges. As Galactus' ship nears, global energy is conserved to power the project, only for Silver Surfer to destroy the bridges. Johnny, now fluent in her language, learns she was an astronomer from Zenn-La who became Galactus' herald to save her planet and daughter. He confronts her in Times Square about the destruction of countless worlds and attempts to reason with her, but she again urges him to give up Franklin to spare his world as she did hers.
 repels Galactus]]
With no way to flee the Solar System, Reed plans to lure Galactus into the last functioning bridge in Times Square and teleport him to the farthest reaches of the universe. But to the team's collective distress, Franklin must be used as bait. The team works with Elder to evacuate New York into his underground realm of Subterranea, Grimm bidding Rozman farewell. When Galactus arrives, the team distracts him and swaps Franklin's baby seat with an empty one, giving the real infant to H.E.R.B.I.E. But Galactus realizes the ruse and seizes Franklin from the Baxter Building. In a desperate battle, Reed, Johnny and Grimm help Sue as she pushes herself past her limits to force him toward the bridge. Johnny nearly sacrifices himself, but Silver Surfer intervenes, ramming Galactus as they are both teleported away.
 revives Invisible Woman]]
Sue collapses, and Reed fails to revive her, until Franklin uses his powers to bring her back. The victory is celebrated, and the Fantastic Four prepare for another appearance on The Ted Gilbert Show, but leave early to answer a distress call. Four years later, Sue is reading to Franklin when she leaves to fetch another book. Returning, she finds a cloaked figure on the couch. He removes his mask, revealing himself to the child.
