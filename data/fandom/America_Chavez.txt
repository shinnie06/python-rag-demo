America Chavez is a girl hailing from the Utopian Parallel with the ability to travel the Multiverse. Chavez was targeted by Scarlet Witch, who sought to acquire her powers, leading to her being relentlessly hunted down by inter-dimensional creatures and monsters. Believing that the Book of Vishanti was the key to eliminate the threat, Chavez came in contact with Doctor Strange and the Masters of the Mystic Arts. In their confrontation with Scarlet Witch, Chavez and Strange sought for the book, but after the altercation with the Illuminati, Chavez was captured by Scarlet Witch. Before she could extract Chavez's powers, she was rescued by Strange and confronted Scarlet Witch, getting her to admit her faults and destroy all copies of the Darkhold. With Scarlet Witch being no longer a threat, Chavez stayed in Strange's universe to study the mystic arts in Kamar-Taj.

## Biography

 

### Early Life

#### Living in the Utopian Parallel

 moments before she and her parents were separated]]
 
America Chavez was born in the Utopian Parallel, a dimension outside the Multiverse EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Xochitl Gomez on Embodying America Chavez and Journeying into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and lived with her mothers, Elena and Amalia Chavez. Chavez had unknowingly developed a special ability to be able to conjure portals to other universes. One day, Chavez was playing in the flowers when a bee suddenly landed on her. Freaking out, Chavez accidentally conjured a portal, causing Chavez and her mothers to be tossed out into the Multiverse. This event would also cause Chavez to be separated from her parents with Chavez believing that she killed them. 
 

#### Traveling the Multiverse

 
Chavez spent the next several years traveling through the Multiverse, accidentally opening new portals whenever she was afraid. She became very knowledgeable of traveling the Multiverse in time and became familiar with how universes worked. Although she looked for variants of herself in other universes, she never found any and believed that she was a unique being in the Multiverse, considering that she never dreamed. By the time she was fourteen, she claimed to have visited seventy-two different universes. Due to her unique nature, Chavez had her existence registered in the Darkhold as a multiversal traveller and a supernatural being. 

### Chased by Scarlet Witch

#### Pursued by Inter-Dimensional Beings

 chased by a creature]]
 
Unbeknownst to Chavez, Scarlet Witch learned about her in the Darkhold and started a crusade to find and steal Chavez's powers. Chavez soon found herself being chased by inter-dimensional beings, believing they wanted her powers. During this time, she met and befriended Doctor Strange in one of these universes. He protected her from these beings and attempted to take her to the Book of Vishanti in the Gap Junction to find a way to stop whatever was after her.
 ]] 
When they arrived in the Gap Junction, they found it destroyed with various sections floating freely about, unaware of what may have caused it. They were then promptly chased by a Ribboned Creature. Strange desperately tried to hold off the Creature, but was unable to contain it, and decided to take Chavez's powers for himself to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands, despite knowing that it would kill her. She asked him what he was doing, stating they were friends, and he responded by telling her that her sacrifice would be worth more than she'd know.
 
Chavez was inadvertently saved when Strange was cut off abruptly by being stabbed by the Creature straight through the torso. Chavez then ran underneath the Creature for the Book, only to be captured by the Creature, bounding all of her limbs. Frightened, she opened a portal behind her. The portal started sucking her and the Creature in, before Strange released her from the Creature and she fell into the portal instead. Chavez and Strange's corpse then entered another universe. 

#### Meeting a New Strange

 ]]
 
Due to the fracturing of the Multiverse How ‘Loki’ Led Us to the ‘Multiverse of Madness’ , Chavez was able to access the primary reality of the Sacred Timeline, and arrived in that universe's New York City. She placed Defender Strange's body on top of a rooftop. She then wandered into the city streets, only to be targeted by another inter-dimensional being, Gargantos, who was invisible at first. Chavez ran inside a bus, but Gargantos used its tentacles to grab the bus and turn it upside down, causing Chavez to fall.
 ]]
She was saved by the Cloak of Levitation who flew her towards this universe's Doctor Strange. She ran behind Strange as Gargantos threw the bus at them, but he used magic to slice it in half. Strange looked at her and asked who she was, but was then knocked aside by Gargantos who continued to chase Chavez. 
 ]]
Chavez ran through the streets as Gargantos caused panic with people running in fear. Eventually, she was caught by Gargantos' tentacle, but was saved by Wong, who arrived from an Inter-Dimensional Portal. When Wong tried to fight Gargantos, it got the upper hand and grabbed him with its tentacle. Chavez hid underneath Gargantos, as Strange returned to assist Wong. Chavez hopped onto a building and tried to avoid Gargantos by getting higher off the ground. Strange and Wong used their magic to grab onto Gargantos, as it scaled the building to get her. Across from them, Christine Palmer and her wedding guests watched from their reception as Strange and Wong worked to get Gargantos away from Chavez. When Gargantos grabbed Strange, he used a spell to grab onto a light pole and stabbed it into Gargantos's eye. 
 and Doctor Strange]]
He then pulled the eye out of its socket and Gargantos fell to the street below, dead. Once on the ground, Strange and Wong demanded to know who Chavez was. However, she stole Strange's Sling Ring and fled without them noticing. She was then found by them again, with Wong noting he still had possession of his own Sling Ring. She returned the Sling Ring back to Strange, who assured her he meant her no harm after risking his life to save her's before asking why she appeared in his dream. Chavez insisted what he dreamed actually happened in another universe. Afterwards, Strange and Wong took her to a nearby pizza restaurant and asked her to explain who she was.
 and Doctor Strange discuss Spider-Man]]
She asked them if they knew anything about the Multiverse, in which Strange stated that they had recent experience with it, along with Spider-Man. Chavez asked more about Spider-Man and they told her he used webs to fight. Chavez thought that was gross. Subsequently, as Strange criticized her for eating too fast while remaining skeptical of her claims, Chavez remarked in Spanish that he wasn't her favorite Doctor Strange out of the two she had already met, only to realize he didn't understand her; she quickly became endeared to Wong when he made a quip about his friend in Spanish.
 and Wong]]
Strange then brought them back to the subject at hand, stating he had left Christine Palmer's wedding to save her, leading Chavez to assume he was the groom before being corrected. Chavez then explained who she was, why monsters were targeting her and her quest for the Book of Vishanti; to her surprise, she learned that Strange wasn't the Sorcerer Supreme. When Strange asked for proof, she brought them to the rooftop and showed them the body of Defender Strange. Wong asked what they should do with the body and Strange buried it using his magic. Strange then stated that the symbols on Strange and Gargantos weren't sorcery but witchcraft. Wong soon realized they had not made proper introductions with Chavez and offered her sanctuary in Kamar-Taj. Chavez cautiously asked Strange if he wouldn't betray her like Defender Strange did, to which he asked her to trust him. 

#### Siege of Kamar-Taj

 ]]
 
Afterwards, Scarlet Witch came to Kamar-Taj, Chavez watched in fear as the Scarlet Witch destroyed and killed everyone in her path. Doctor Strange then traps Scarlet Witch in the Mirror Dimension to buy some time.
 and Doctor Strange protect Chavez]]
Doctor Strange and Wong came to her to get her out of Kamar-Taj, but Scarlet Witch disintegrated Strange's Sling Ring and started using the water reflections to try to catch Chavez. Although Chavez, Strange, and Wong have covered their reflections, Scarlet Witch passes through an interdimensional portal, escaping the Mirror Dimension and arriving at the place where Chavez is.
 ]]
After Scarlet Witch elaborated her motivation of using Chavez's powers to become the mother of Tommy and Billy Maximoff in an alternate universe, followed by Strange and Wong's failed attempts to fight her off, she flings the sorcerers away and telekinetically grabs Chavez as she begins to absorb Chavez's powers. Chavez began to open a series of portals and was saved by Strange and the two begin to pass through various random realities, but not before Scarlet Witch uses her powers to damage the Cloak of Levitation. 

#### Escaping through the Multiverse

 if he is okay]]
 
Chavez and Strange fell through a number of universes through various portals, eventually landing in Earth-838. Strange chided Chavez for the lack of control over her powers, stating that he could control them better than her. This caused her to recoil as it reminded her of Defender Strange and his betrayal, and Strange apologized. They left to search for help in this new universe, with Chavez acting as the guide due to her previous experience with Multiversal travel.
 exploring Earth-838]]
Chavez took a pizza ball from a street vendor, explaining to Strange that food was free in most universes, and asked Strange if that was the same in his universe. This didn't turn out to be entirely true, as Pizza Poppa caught up to her and angrily demanded she pay him immediately for the food she had taken. Strange responded by casting a spell that forced the man to punch himself in the face repeatedly, quipping that this would allegedly continue for three weeks. 

#### Captured by Baron Mordo

 ]]
 
Chavez and Doctor Strange came across Earth 838's New York Sanctum, which had a towering statue dedicated to that universe's Doctor Strange in front of it. The plaque read that Strange sacrificed his life defeating Thanos. Approaching the entrance, Strange wondered who was the Sorcerer Supreme in that universe until the door opened and Baron Karl Mordo walked through. Strange then explained the relationship between himself and Karl Mordo of his universe to Chavez, which worried her.
 ]]
However, Mordo greeted Strange as a brother and welcomed the two into the Sanctum. Once inside, Chavez and Strange were offered tea, which they drank as they explained their situation to Mordo. Mordo then told them about the dreamwalking ritual which was a desecration to reality itself. However, they soon began to feel dizzy. They realized that their tea had been drugged, and they passed out. 

#### Imprisoned at Illuminati Headquarters

 
 
Chavez woke up at the Illuminati Headquarters in a sealed polycarbonate glass chamber, where she had been placed by the Illuminati so scientists could study her and ensure she was not carrying an unknown disease from another universe or was any other kind of hazard. She remained in her chamber even after Doctor Strange was escorted out to be interviewed by the Illuminati.
 approaching]]
Scarlet Witch, dreamwalking in the body of her 838 Variant, soon broke into the compound and killed the Illuminati, and entered the room where Chavez was being held. Christine Palmer desperately attempted to open Chavez's cell, but the computer interface was disrupted by Scarlet Witch's powers. Palmer then attempted to break the glass open with a metal container but was unsuccessful. Chavez punched the side of the chamber, creating a large star-shaped dent large enough to free herself. Professor X then entered the room and engaged Scarlet Witch in a mental battle, giving Chavez and Palmer enough time to escape.
 ]]
Chavez and Palmer headed for a hall as they heard footsteps, thinking that it was the Scarlet Witch. However, Chavez and Palmer were relieved that it was Strange. Chavez happily ran to Strange and embraced him then told him that Palmer fixed his Cloak of Levitation. Also, Chavez told Palmer that this version of Strange is different than the latter she knew from her universe.
 ]]
The three fled from Scarlet Witch into the tunnels of the Illuminati Headquarters. They eventually reached the Book of Vishanti, but Maximoff caught up with them and destroyed the book before it could be used. She then tapped into Chavez's powers, using them to send Strange and Palmer through a portal before opening a portal to Mount Wundagore in her universe and taking Chavez through it. 

#### Battle on Mount Wundagore

 ]]
 
Upon returning to Mount Wundagore, Scarlet Witch placed Chavez on the altar, intending to strip her of her powers. However, the ritual is intercepted by Wong and the arrival of Doctor Strange, the latter having dreamwalked into Defender Strange's body. Rather than take Chavez's power, Strange told her to trust herself and trust her power in order to stop Wanda, telling her that she was controlling it all along as every portal she opens sent them exactly where they needed to go.
 ]]
Inspired by Strange's words, Chavez leaped off the altar and used her powers against Maximoff, punching her into various portals. One point, she punched Maximoff into a fiery hellish universe, but Maximoff gained the upper hand and pushed Chavez back. Seeing that she cannot beat Maximoff but knowing what can, Chavez transported them to Earth-838 inside the Vision Residence. Chavez watched as Maximoff realized what she had become upon seeing how Billy and Tommy reacted to her, then brought herself and Maximoff back to their universe.
 ]]
As Maximoff prepared to destroy the mountain, the Darkhold, and every copy of it within the Multiverse, Chavez opened up a portal back to Kamar-Taj and fled with Wong through before Maximoff destroyed the mountain. Eventually, she opens up another portal in front of Strange and Christine Palmer and so they could go through and returned to Strange's universe. 

### Becoming a Master

#### Training at Kamar-Taj

 ]]
 
Chavez decided to stay in Doctor Strange's reality and began training with the Masters of the Mystic Arts at Kamar-Taj.

 ]]
Chavez's impatience caused her to fall behind the other students, and she expressed frustration at how much harder magic was than creating star portals. Wong mused to Doctor Strange that she reminded him of Strange when he first entered Kamar-Taj. After practice, Chavez told Strange with feigned excitement that she had managed to create sparks, and Strange replied that her mothers would be proud of her. Chavez told Strange that she was glad that she landed in his universe, and he reciprocated the feeling before leaving.
