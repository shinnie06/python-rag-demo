The Quantum Realm is a universe outside of time and space accessible through either shrinking to beyond a subatomic size or magic.

## History

### Janet van Dyne's Odyssey

#### Final Mission

 
Access to the Quantum Realm was finally realized by scientist Doctor Hank Pym through the use of Pym Particles, particles of an extra-dimensional nature that are capable of altering the size of beings or objects. Janet van Dyne, Pym's wife and the first person to bear the mantle of Wasp, disappeared into the Quantum Realm after sacrificing her life to disable a Soviet nuclear missile. Janet van Dyne became a resident of the Quantum Realm through this sacrifice. Following this event, Pym dedicated himself to researching the Quantum Realm, though he was unable to generate concrete results or information. Pym would record his research in several journals, which would later be read by Cassie Lang. 

#### Trapped with the Conqueror

 
While trapped in the Quantum Realm, Janet van Dyne had made an isolated living within the dimension. As she went outside her homestead, Kang the Conqueror's Time Sphere had broken into the realm and crash-landed near van Dyne's home. After arming herself, she rushed to the crash site and was confronted by several Quantum Wolves who pinned van Dyne to the ground. Richards was able to save van Dyne as the two became acquainted with each other with van Dyne helping to pull the Time Chair out of the ground.

Together, van Dyne and Richards began work on fixing the Time Chair's energy core, though it was still nonfunctional after several attempts. On one of their breaks, van Dyne regretted not being there for her daughter Hope after her mission with Hank. However, Kang persuaded van Dyne that she could return to Hope once they left the Realm. After several tries, the two were able to fix the energy core.

As the two prepared to depart, van Dyne attached the energy core and viewed Richards' mind: his moniker as Kang the Conqueror, his campaign against the Multiverse, severing the connections of multiple realities and timelines from existence. After learning about his exile, van Dyne hesitated to go with Richards as he continued to pressure her. With the Chair reactivated, Kang was able to re-equip his armor, allowing him to gain his powers back. In a rush, van Dyne took the energy core from the Chair as Kang tried to stop her. Using the Pym Particle Discs she had left, van Dyne was able to stop the core from being used, trapping herself and Kang within the realm. However, with his armor back, Kang was able to build his own empire within the Realm over time and continued to hunt down van Dyne. 

#### Freedom Fighting Days

While expanding his empire, Kang displaced the native inhabitants of the Quantum Realm, with many of them being killed or forced into hiding during Kang's conquests. In response, Janet van Dyne met Krylar and Jentorra, and helped form a freedom fighting movement against Kang the Conqueror and his forces. During their time together, van Dyne talked about her daughter, Hope van Dyne, and husband, Hank Pym, with Krylar, and the two began to date. 

### Outsiders' Interactions

#### Escaping the Quantum Realm

 
 in the Quantum Realm]]
In 2015, after defeating Darren Cross, Scott Lang was transported into the Quantum Realm, but managed to escape by altering the Ant-Man Suit's mechanisms; replacing the shrinking regulator with an enlarging one by installing a blue Pym Particle Disc in his regulator. Later, Lang claimed to have no recollection of what he experienced there. 

#### Rescue of Jemma Simmons

 
Upon the disappearance of Jemma Simmons through the Monolith, Leo Fitz briefly researched into the Quantum Realm, exploring the possibility that she was there. 

#### Stephen Strange's Journey

 passing through the Quantum Realm]]
In 2016, when Stephen Strange came to Kamar-Taj, the Ancient One sent his consciousness through several dimensions and realities, including the Quantum Realm. 

### Scientists' Usage

#### Rescue of Janet van Dyne

 
In 2018, Scott Lang received an apparent message from Janet van Dyne in the form of a shared memory of her daughter, which allowed Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne to confirm their suspicions about Janet being alive. They briefly opened a Quantum Tunnel to the Quantum Realm, however, it was only able to be open for a few seconds. Later, when able to open a more stable tunnel, Janet, sending a message through Lang, gave her exact location, before revealing that there were only two hours before the Quantum Realm's instability would move her, causing her to disappear for another century.
 and Janet van Dyne reunite in the Quantum Realm]]
Just before going through with the rescue, Pym told Lang and Hope that he would be the one to enter the Quantum Realm, allowing Lang and Hope to distract Ghost away from the lab, in an effort to have an unproblematic rescue. With the battle for the laboratory ongoing, Pym entered the Quantum Realm with just about 15 minutes left before Janet's location would change. Upon arriving at Janet's location, however, Pym became disoriented due to the Quantum Realm's nature, but Janet was able to find him and they reunited. They then came back with the lab, with it having returned to its original size. 

#### Trapped in the Quantum Realm

 trapped in the Quantum Realm]]
 
Due to Ghost still needing additional quantum energy, Scott Lang was sent back into the Quantum Realm with a device to absorb Quantum Healing Particles. However, while he was doing this task, the Snap occurred. Coincidentally, Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, and Hope van Dyne were among the victims, leaving no-one at the controls to bring Lang out of the Quantum Realm. 

#### Used by S.H.I.E.L.D.

 and the Chronicoms travel through the Quantum Realm]]
 
During S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Chronicom Colonization of Earth as Zephyr One traveled back in time to create an alternate timeline to ensure the survival of Kora, Leo Fitz shrunk down into the Quantum Realm to act as a bridge between timelines, guiding the plane's jumps from where he was observing the Chronicoms' movements. Eventually, Fitz emerged from the Quantum Realm into The Krazy Kanoe thanks to the Quantum Tunnel that Jemma Simmons assembled. S.H.I.E.L.D. subsequently linked the Quantum Tunnel to Zephyr One to travel through the Quantum Realm back to the original timeline, bringing the orbit Chronicom Vessels with them in the process. 

### Time Heist

#### Scott Lang's Return

 
Pronounced dead by society as his body was never recovered, Scott Lang remained trapped in the Quantum Realm as the van was placed in a warehouse. For Lang's luck, however, a rat happened to sniff around the truck, accidentally setting the controls to bring him back, causing Lang to be shot from the truck to a bunch of garbage, bringing him back to reality. Five years had passed, but for Lang, it had only been five hours. 

#### Traveling Through Time

 
In 2023, the Quantum Realm was essential in the Avengers' plan to undo the Snap. Scott Lang introduced the idea of going into the Quantum Realm to acquire versions of the Infinity Stones, since in the present, the Stones were destroyed. Bruce Banner initiated tests, sending Lang into the Realm and having him walk for an hour there, while in present time, Banner would get him out almost immediately. While the initial tests were unsuccessful, with Lang turning back into a kid, an old man, and a baby in the tests, the final test worked, as Lang was able to return in his correct age and appearance.
 traveling through time in the Quantum Realm]]
Meanwhile, Tony Stark managed to perfectly simulate a travel path by turning it into an inverted Möbius strip. He eventually brought the model he created to the Avengers Compound in order to do a final test run. Clint Barton volunteered to the test run and was able to travel the Quantum Realm to land in a timeline where his family was still alive. The test was proved to be successful when Barton brought back a glove taken from that timeline.
 travel through time in the Quantum Realm]]
With the quantum time travel mechanics now perfected, the Avengers split up and traversed the Quantum Realm to different points in time: Steve Rogers, Stark, Banner, and Lang set out to the Battle of New York in 2012 in order to get the Time Stone, the Tesseract, and the Mind Stone; Nebula, James Rhodes, Romanoff, and Barton traveled to 2014 to get the Orb in Morag as well as the Soul Stone in Vormir; and Thor and Rocket traveled to Asgard in 2013 to extract the Aether from Jane Foster during the Second Dark Elf Conflict.

After being unable to retrieve the Tesseract, Stark and Rogers used a few Pym Particles left to travel through the Quantum Realm again, this time, to an alternate 1970 in Camp Lehigh in order to steal the Tesseract there and acquire more Pym Particles. 

#### Attack on the Avengers Compound

 travelling through the Quantum Realm]]
An alternate 2014 version of Nebula traveled the Quantum Realm to the main timeline, specifically to the Avengers Compound. There she opened an entry route for an alternate version of the Sanctuary II to travel the Realm to the main timeline. The sheer size of the warship led to the destruction of the Avengers' Quantum Tunnel, disabling access to the Quantum Realm. 

#### Battle of Earth

During the battle, Scott Lang announced that Luis' van still contained a Quantum Tunnel. However, alternate Thanos used his sword to destroy the Quantum Tunnel. This action led to an incredible burst of Quantum energy coming out of the Quantum Realm onto the Avengers Compound's grounds which blasted Carol Danvers and others backwards. 

#### Returning the Stones

In the aftermath of the Blip, Bruce Banner used another Quantum Tunnel in order to return the Infinity Stones and Mjølnir to their respective timelines. Steve Rogers volunteered to do the task, and traveled back into the Quantum Realm. After returning the items, Rogers traveled the Realm far back to an alternate 1940s, where he married an alternate Peggy Carter and lived a long, fulfilling life. Once he was an old man, he traveled the Realm a final time back to Earth-616. 

### War on Kang the Conqueror

#### Cassie Lang's Experiment

 in a basement.|Hank Pym to Scott Lang|Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania}}
Cassie Lang, during the Blip, started to read Hank Pym's journals he had kept on his studies. She began to take a particular interest on the Quantum Realm, and once Pym returned, Lang began to ask Pym questions about the Quantum Realm. Hope van Dyne eventually joined the two, and they worked on a Quantum Satellite in order to communicate with the Quantum Realm without physically traveling there. In 2026, van Dyne, Lang, and Pym showed Scott Lang and Janet van Dyne what they had been working on, activating the Satellite. The Satellite sent a signal down into the Quantum Realm, until Janet van Dyne shut off the signal. However, she yanked out the wires too late, and M.O.D.O.K. took control of the signal, having hijacked the satellite and sending all five, along with some nearby Ants, into the Quantum Realm. 

#### Pym and Lang Families Stranded

 
On the path down, the group got separated, with Hank Pym, along with Hope and Janet van Dyne stranded in the Quantum Jungle. Hope, having landed a short distance from Pym and Janet, called out for her parents, before Pym called back to her. Pym said that they should be dead, and noted the difference in appearance in the Quantum Realm on this journey. Pym then called out for Janet, when they noticed a blue light heading towards them. Janet appeared and told them not to move, and as the light passed above them, she pushed them against one of the trees. Janet then said they needed to find Scott and Cassie Lang, who had been separated from the two on the trip down.

Meanwhile, Scott and Cassie had landed in a different area of the Quantum Realm, and the two quickly found one another and hugged each other, with Scott telling Cassie it was okay. Scott attempted to call for the others, but was met with no reply. Scott repeatedly told Cassie it was going to be okay, and Cassie replied that he was telling her it was okay too much. As Scott attempted to comfort Cassie by comparing the trip to camping, he was attacked by a Sun Beast, which was soon devoured by another beast, which then swiftly approached the Langs. Suddenly, the group was saved by the Freedom Fighters, who left the Langs confused at finding life within the Quantum Realm.

Pym and Hope began to question Janet about why she did not explain how she knew about the ships, when she had prior said that there was nothing in the Quantum Realm. Janet retorted that she told them not to look at the Quantum Realm, before Pym and Janet apologized to one another. As they walked to exit the Jungle, Janet began to explain how through the Quantum Void Sub-Atomica, there was universes within universes, outside of time and space. Once out in the open, the three were found by a group of travelers, and Janet said she would handle them. Janet began to counter with the leader once they unmasked themselves, before they hugged, Janet having secured the three a ride. Janet then approached the winged beast, and mounted it. 
 is questioned by the Freedom Fighters]]
The Langs were then taken to the Freedom Fighters' headquarters, and along the way Scott was separated from Cassie. Cassie drank some of the Ooze, and when she saw her father, told him to drink the ooze as well, to Scott's shock. Following some reluctance, Scott eventually was force fed the Ooze, which allowed him to understand Veb and the Freedom Fighters. As Veb introduced himself, Scott was still confused, which caused Veb to think that Scott did not drink him yet, and volunteered to put some more ooze down his holes. Veb noted how Scott's mouth was huge, and asked how many holes Scott had, to which Scott replied he had no holes, before Quaz clarified that Scott had seven holes, following him introducing Scott to the group. Scott said that was correct, and when he asked Quaz how he knew that, Veb said that Quaz was a telepath, to which Quaz expressed that people are disgusting and he wished he was unable to read minds. Quaz then told Scott to stop thinking about the disgusting thing he thought, and Scott thought Quaz's head looked weird, and when Quaz called him out on it, Scott lied about it. Veb asked if Scott was a spy, and Cassie reappeared, and said that he was her father. Quaz asked who San Francisco was, and then when the Langs said that was where they were from, Quaz asked what Earth was, and Scott replied that was also where they were from. Xolum then suggested they should torture the Langs, and Veb asked if the Langs had fluids come out of their holes, both of which Quaz shut down. Quaz asked where they were from, and the Langs attempted to explain where they were from, and Quaz said it was okay because they were telling the truth. Jentorra then walked up, and said that it did not matter if they had told the truth, because they came from above, Conqueror would come to find them.

Quaz scanned the Langs' minds, and found they were clueless about everything, before Scott clarified that he simply wanted to find his family. When Scott noted that one of the nearby buildings was alive, Veb was shocked that Scott lived in dead buildings. Scott said he wanted to go home, and Jentorra said he was lucky to still have a home, and recounted how the Conqueror had destroyed their homes. Cassie began to tell Scott that they should help the inhabitants, but Scott replied that it was not their fight, which caused Cassie to become disappointed in Scott. Scott said that Janet was the person who knew the inner workings of the Quantum Realm best, and Jentorra began to question how they knew Janet, and said that she should not be in the Quantum Realm. 
 ]]
Pym and the van Dynes then traveled to a bar, and Pym remarked at the inhabitants, particularly the Broccoli Man. When Janet noticed some Quantumnauts, she told Pym and Hope to keep their head down, as they followed her to meet Krylar. Janet opened a door, revealing a luxurious bar, where she ordered some Ooze for Pym and Hope. Janet signaled to a nearby patron that they needed to speak to Krylar, and when recognized, she told them to keep her identity secret. Pym found a bartender and asked for a beverage to get him drunk, as the Broccoli Man began to flirt with Hope. Janet returned to Pym and Hope, and told the Broccoli Man to move out of the way, and began to explain how she knew Krylar from when they were Freedom Fighters together. Krylar arrived, having made a spectacle of an entrance when he left his Yacht, and recognized Pym and Hope from the tales that Janet had told him. Krylar, hungry, demanded his men to do it now. Krylar drank his drink, and when Janet asked for the location of a fellow human, Krylar responded to Pym that he was not technically human. The Quantumnauts arrived through the door, and Krylar told them not yet and to let him talk. Krylar recounted how Janet had left them with him, and that he was not lying when he remembered how many lives Janet had killed when she left him with them. Krylar then revealed that he had sent M.O.D.O.K. after their friends, which prompted Pym to ask where their friends were, and Krylar responded how he did not know but they were probably dead. Krylar told Janet to give him what he wanted, and Janet asked Krylar what happened, and Krylar responded that he could be very persuasive. Krylar then signaled to the Quantumnauts, who began to attack the bar patrons. Pym, Hope, and Janet fought off the Quantumnauts, but as more arrived, they escaped on the Yacht. 

Following some confusion on the controls of the Yacht, Pym drove off, and then Hope questioned Janet's choice of Krylar, to which she revealed she had dated him for a time. Pym also revealed he had dated one woman, but it did not turn out well since she was not Janet. Hope questioned Janet about what was after Scott and Cassie, and she said that she had tried to protect them, which prompted Hope to ask what had frightened her so much.
 attacking Scott and Cassie Lang]]
At the Freedom Fighter's headquarters, several Quantumnauts began to lay siege to the area. The Langs dodged multiple buildings as they ran, and Xolum escaped with Veb per Jentorra's command. A Quantumnaut told Jentorra to give up the Langs, before it pinned her down. Cassie, unable to resist the urge to help, returned to help fight. Following a brief teaching lesson of how to properly use the suit from Scott, Cassie returned to the fight. Quaz told the now standing Jentorra they had to go, having detected M.O.D.O.K.'s approach. M.O.D.O.K. then revealed himself to Scott, and said he was an old adversary, and unmasked himself as Darren Cross. Scott remarked how he was surprised to see Cross again, and Cross threatened Scott, telling him there was nowhere to run, before he took them into custody. 

#### Kang the Conqueror's Deal

 
Scott and Cassie Lang, now imprisoned in a holding cell on the Celestium in Axia, were approached by M.O.D.O.K., who prepared them to meet the Conqueror.

Meanwhile, Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne, still on Krylar's Yacht, listened as Janet van Dyne recounted her first meeting with the Conqueror, and how she was marveled by his ship which was able to travel the multiverse, which aroused awe from Pym at the multiverse being real. She went on to recount how they rebuilt the Time Sphere in order to leave and how she felt when Kang had destroyed multiple timelines within the multiverse, which caused her to destroy the Time Sphere's Multiversal Engine Core using her Pym Particle Discs in order to protect her family and the multiverse, at the potential cost of seeing her daughter again. Janet revealed that Kang needed Pym Particles in order to fix his Time Sphere, which elicited worry from Pym, knowing Scott and Cassie were taken by him.
 introduces himself to Scott Lang]]
Kang approached Lang, and spoke to Scott, remarking that he is an interesting man. Scott tried to intimidate him by proclaiming that he was a member of the Avengers, but Kang was unimpressed due to all the Avengers he had killed throughout his life, briefly mistaking Scott for Thor. Kang told Scott that he is a man who had lost a lot of time, just like him, and they could potentially help each other, and noted Scott's skills as a thief. M.O.D.O.K. interrupted and mentioned the last time Scott stole something from him, but Kang threw him against the wall with his telekinesis for speaking in his presence. He retorted that Janet was more helpful, which prompted a surprised reaction from Scott. Kang explained that Janet stole his only way out of the Quantum Realm and Scott was the only man who could steal it back and return it to Kang. As Scott asked why would he help Kang, he informed him and Cassie that only he could stop the arrival of his Variants, claiming they exiled Kang because they were afraid of him. Kang then claimed that in exchange, he could help all of them to get back home, but Scott rejected his offer. Kang then began telekinetically torturing Lang, until Scott begged Kang to kill him. When Cassie tried to tell her father not to listen to the threats, Kang turned his attention to Cassie and began to torture her. Kang gave Scott a choice of whether he wanted his daughter to live or die, and Scott reluctantly accepted the deal with Kang. He then let both him and Cassie out their cells, and as Scott demanded him to not hurt his daughter again, Kang replied that he must bring him what he wanted. Kang then opened a portal to the enlarged Multiversal Engine Core, and M.O.D.O.K., Cassie, Scott, Kang, and two Quantumnauts walked into the core.
 rescues Ant-Man inside of the Multiversal Engine Core]]
Meanwhile, on the outside of the core, Pym and the van Dynes flew up to look at the core, noting they had to get to the center. Inside, Scott comforted Cassie, who was then pulled away from her father, who had given her a Pym Particle Disc, before he dove towards the center of the core. Inside, Scott kept communication with M.O.D.O.K. who explained the situation to him as he entered the probability storm, causing hundreds of Scott Langs to show up around him. Some of the Scotts attempted to grow and reach the center of the core, but they passed. The Scotts all attempted to little success to reach the core, before they all realized, with a little motivation from Cassie, they had to work together to get to the top. The main Scott climbed to the top, which shocked M.O.D.O.K. As Scott was nearly there, the Pym Particle Disc he fired in did nothing, which caused the tower of Scotts to begin to wobble. Meanwhile, on the other side, Hope entered, with Janet telling her to ignore the other versions of her, which Hope ignored, and all the Hopes began to work with all the Scotts to get the main Hope and main Scott to fire Pym Particle Discs into the core, which caused it to revert to normal. 

Janet met with Scott and Hope, and Janet told Scott they had to leave immediately, which drew protests from Scott who did not want to leave Cassie. Then Kang, arriving on the scene, told Scott not to trust Janet and greeted Hope, and called her "Jellybean", before he asked Scott what he would do next. Kang then asked Scott if he needed to take the Core, and Scott asked for his daughter, calling upon their deal, but Kang took the core using his Telekinesis. Scott attacked Kang along with Hope in retaliation, but he was knocked to the ground. Meanwhile, M.O.D.O.K. flew up to Pym, and unmasked, which shocked Pym to see Cross again, and M.O.D.O.K. attacked the Yacht, which caused Pym to crash in the distance. Janet noticed the crash, and attempted to run after her husband, but Kang stopped her, before he took her back to his base. Pym was then found by his Ants that had been sucked into the Quantum Realm along with him, who then together with the Ants went to meet Scott and Hope. Pym revealed that he had felt several strange signals from the now technologically and temporally advanced ants that developed a civilization his entire trip, and that ants do not give up. Pym then quoted Scott's book, and said that there was always room to grow, and they should get to work.

Back at his base, Kang questioned Janet about what she saw when she saw into his mind using the Time Sphere, and Janet replied that she saw a monster. Kang replied that because he was the only one who could see time was broken, by his own hand, that he had to be the one to play god, destroying the countless timelines. He went on to say how endless Incursions had been caused, so he had to take control.When pressed by Janet about what he had lost, Kang went on to say that he would burn his variants out of time, because they had bested him. 

#### Uprising in Axia

 
Once Scott Lang had successfully shrunk the Multiversal Engine Core, Cassie Lang was taken back to be put in her cell by two Quantumnauts. However, as they walked down a hallway, Lang used Pym Particle Discs on the Quantumnauts and escaped from them by shrinking herself and running away. Cassie Lang then approached Jentorra's cell and attempted to open the cell when several Quantumnauts approached. Lang swiftly defeated the Quantumnauts using the skills that Scott Lang had taught her earlier, and knocked one Quantumnauts's head into the keypad, which opened the cell door. Cassie apologized to Jentorra for hurting the Freedom Fighters, and Jentorra asked Cassie if she had a plan. Cassie said her plan was freeing Jentorra, and then Jentorra revealed her plan to get a message out to start an uprising, to which Cassie quickly agreed to before she followed Jentorra to the communications room.

 inspires the Axia citizens to fight back]]
Kang the Conqueror meanwhile showed Janet van Dyne his army of Quantumnuts, and began to give a speech, planning to lead them to multiverse domination. However, his speech was interrupted by Cassie, who spoke about how Kang was not invincible, and it was still possible to beat him. Cassie went on to explain how while it may feel like they have already lost, the family she lost taught her to look out for the little guy, and never look the other way, and that Kang was unable to take them all if they worked together. Jentorra, dodging heavy fire begged Cassie to leave, and together they left to free the other prisoners. Kang, having seen the speech, told M.O.D.O.K. to find and kill Cassie, which alarmed Janet as she was held back by two Quantumnauts. Kang then ordered his men to began the launch of Axia. M.O.D.O.K. began to chase after Cassie and Jentorra as they had attempted to free the other prisoners, and chased her outside, telling her that her father would be unable to save her. Suddenly, the ground began to shake from an enlarged and enraged Scott Lang, which alerted Cassie, Kang, and M.O.D.O.K. Scott angrily yelled at Kang that they had a deal, and he wanted his daughter back. Scott stepped through the city, smashing the buildings and squishing all the Quantumnauts in his path. However Kang's forces quickly overwhelmed Scott, until the Freedom Fighters arrived, the buildings flying through the air shooting at Kang's forces. 

The newly freed Quaz worked with Jentorra to lower the bridge using a code he had telekinetically acquired from a Quantumnaut. Veb and Xolum led a ground attack on the Quantumnauts, but Veb was hit by a turret while doing a war cry, which gave him holes, to his pleasure. Veb, now enhanced by his new found holes, began to suck the Quantumnauts into his holes. Kang, meanwhile, finalized the preparations on his departure, and activated a protective sphere around the building. Scott pushed through heavy fire using a nearby roof as a shield to reach the Celestium, attempting to stop Kang from leaving. Cassie ran to Scott, who had now collapsed after he had failed to pry open the sphere using the rooftop, but she was cut off by M.O.D.O.K., who approached her with his weapons activated. Cassie then grew herself, and when M.O.D.O.K. fired a saw on a cable, grabbed the cable and threw M.O.D.O.K. around. M.O.D.O.K. then begged to continue to fight, but Cassie told him to stop being whatever he was trying to be, and M.O.D.O.K. replied he did not know what he was trying to be. Cassie told him to just not be a dick, and Cross said it was too late for him. Cassie responded that it was never too late to stop being a dick, and left Cross behind.

Scott, along with Hope van Dyne, looking for a way into the sphere to stop Kang, quickly came up with a new idea in. Scott shrunk himself before he was thrown by Hope into the sphere, and mid air grew himself, cannonballing into the sphere, which broke it and Kang's machine out. Scott, still enlarged, stood up, when he noticed Cassie, also still enlarged, running towards him. The two hugged and expressed awe at how large they were, and Cassie said she wanted a lime, which drew corroboration from Scott over wanting citrus. With the sphere now disabled, the Freedom Fighters began to advance on the Celestium.
 
As Janet and Kang regained their footing, Janet told Kang it was over, but Kang told her it was never over, and a Quantumnaut grabbed her. Kang then descended from the Celestium, in full armor, massacring any in his way, including Xolum. Kang then was confronted by Scott, Cassie, and Hope, who fought him, shrinking and growing in attempt to defeat him. Scott was knocked back by one of Kang's blows, and the three reconvened while Kang began to speak about how he was Kang, and Scott was only a man who could talk to ants. Just then, Hank Pym arrived with an army of Ants, which surrounded him and quickly demolished Kang's forces. Kang put up a protective force field, when Cross flew in, and proclaimed he was not a dick as he disabled the force field. The Ants overwhelmed Kang, and Hank apologized for being late. Cross told Cassie she was right, and when recognized, Cross greeted Hope. Cross thanked Scott, and said he was like a brother to him, which drew confusion from Scott before he accepted it. Cross used his last words to say he at least died an Avenger, and Scott just accepted it. Janet, having escaped the Quantumnaunts, called Pym and told him they had one shot left to return home. The Freedom Fighters approached the four, and as Jentorra told them they could handle the remainder of Kang's forces, Veb hugged Cassie before Pym told the others they had to go.

Pym, Hope, Cassie, and Scott flew up to the control room on Ants, where Janet waited for them, with an open portal. They all entered one by one, but before Scott could enter, he was blasted back by Kang. Kang ran for the portal, but Scott was able to push him back. Scott and Kang then began to fight, with Kang brutally beating up Scott, teasing him over being able to see his daughter again had he looked the other way and allowed him to escape. Kang taunted Scott that he thought he could win, but Scott said he did not have to win, they just both had to lose. Scott then put a handful of Pym Particle Disks onto the Multiversal Engine Core, which scared Kang, who quickly ran for the portal. Just as he was about to reach the other side, Hope arrived through, and blasted him back into the unstable core. As the core started to collapse, Kang was sucked into a vortex and screamed from pain, before disappearing in one last burst of energy. Scott and Hope then reunited, and Scott asked Hope about Cassie, who Hope said was fine on the other side of the now closed portal. Scott winced in pain as the two hugged, and they proclaimed their love for each other before looking over the city through the window. Meanwhile back on Earth, Cassie opened a portal using the Quantum Satellite, before Scott and Hope left to return back home. 

### Alternate Universe

#### Quantum Virus

 in the Quantum Realm]]
 
In an alternate universe, Janet van Dyne contracted a quantum virus during her thirty-year stay in the Quantum Realm, which transformed her into a zombie. In 2018, her husband Hank Pym entered the Quantum Realm to rescue her, where he was subsequently attacked and infected. The pair were then extracted out of the Quantum Realm by Hope van Dyne, where they infected the citizens of Earth and began the Zombie Apocalypse. 

#### Earth-828

In an alternate universe, the magazine Engineered included an article on the Quantum Realm titled "Quantum Realm 101". 

## Nature and Structure

 in the Quantum Realm's void]]
 
The Quantum Realm is said by Hank Pym to be a largely unexplored dimension, about which scientists currently know very little. Pym also says the concepts of time and space become irrelevant when entering the realm, and whoever tries to explore it may become trapped "for eternity".

Scott Lang's incursion into the Quantum Realm began on a microscopic level, then entered atomic size, later dissolving into pure energy and waves, then in a fractal-like reality where the shrinking person meets an infinite number of mirror images of themselves, and ending in the Quantum Void, a weightless dark void with pockets of dim light. However, this comprised only one layer of the Quantum Realm as Pym was able to travel to another layer of the Quantum Realm, known as Sub-Atomica, using the Quantum Tunnel to rescue his wife Janet. 
 opening in an alternate timeline]]
The nature of the Quantum Realm is such that you can enter at one point in time and exit at another. This can also be extended to jumping from one alternate timeline to another as done by Leo Fitz in the Chronicom Colonization of Earth, and by Steve Rogers when he traveled to the realities the Avengers created during the Time Heist to return the Infinity Stones. 

Time in the Quantum Realm works non-linearly, allowing people from two different eras to meet and interact with each other, as Kang the Conqueror was able to find and interact with Janet van Dyne even though she was trapped there at the time He Who Remains controlled the Sacred Timeline and there were no variants of him.

The Quantum Realm is also capable of being entered through the use of magic.
