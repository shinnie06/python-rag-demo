The Infinity Gauntlet was a powerful Dwarven-made Uru glove that was designed to channel the power of all six Infinity Stones.

## History

### Forging the Gauntlet

 
 at Nidavellir with his new Gauntlet]]
By 2015, Thanos decided to collect the Infinity Stones himself. To do so, he went to Nidavellir and forced the Dwarves to construct the Infinity Gauntlet for him. Once they had done so, he proceeded to exterminate the entire Dwarven race. Only Eitri, the King of the Dwarves, was spared, although Thanos destroyed his hands by smelting them in metal, ensuring he could never create anything further on his own. 

### Infinity War

 
 uses the Power Stone to detonate the Statesman]]
In 2018, Thanos brandished the Infinity Gauntlet on his left hand and forearm, inserting the stones one-by-one as soon as he acquired them. Upon acquiring the Power Stone from the Nova Corps Vault on Xandar, Thanos attacked the Statesman. Thanos used the Power Stone to torture Thor in order to force Loki to give up the Space Stone. Thanos then inserted it into the Gauntlet and used it to block Loki's attempted attack before strangling and killing him. Thanos then used the Power Stone to destroy the ship while opening a wormhole with the Space Stone so he and his children could escape.
 alters Star-Lord's blaster shot]]
Thanos soon ventured to Knowhere, acquiring the Reality Stone from the Collector and inserting it into the Infinity Gauntlet. Thanos used the Stone to trick the Guardians of the Galaxy by conjuring an illusion of himself interrogating the Collector. After he revealed his true self, Thanos incapacitated Drax and Mantis, stopped Star-Lord's desperate attempt to kill Gamora and left with his daughter via the Space Stone.
 tortures Nebula]]
Back on his ship, Thanos used the Power and Space Stones to torture Nebula by slowly pulling apart her cybernetics, forcing Gamora to give up the location of the Soul Stone, revealed to be on Vormir. On Vormir, he and Gamora encountered Red Skull and upon realizing he must sacrifice the one he loved, Thanos tearfully threw Gamora off a cliff to her death to acquire the Soul Stone. After inserting it into the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos traveled to Titan to collect the Time Stone.
 reveals the past beauty of Titan]]
Upon arriving on his homeworld, Thanos was confronted by Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy, who attacked him with the intent of removing the Infinity Gauntlet from his hand. Thanos used the Infinity Gauntlet to destroy the pillar dropped on him by Iron Man, and turned it to a swarm of black crystals that he sent at the ironclad Avenger, as well as sending out blasts of energy at Star-Lord, although they were dodged. Doctor Strange soon realized that Thanos had to clench his fist for the Gauntlet to work and had the Cloak of Levitation restrain his left hand. Enraged, Thanos soon ripped the Cloak from his hand and used the Gauntlet to absorb an explosion caused by Iron Man and then redirected the blow towards the hero.
 telekinetically rips apart Titan's moon]]
Eventually, Thanos was restrained through a carefully organized strategy of Star-Lord's plan and Mantis was able to immobilize the warlord before Iron Man and Spider-Man began removing the Gauntlet. As Iron Man and Spider-Man came close to slipping off the Gauntlet, Star-Lord, after realizing that Thanos had killed Gamora, repeatedly hit the Titan in a vengeful rage, breaking Mantis' hold on Thanos and allowing him to regain the Gauntlet. Thanos then used the mighty gauntlet to display the ultimate power of the Stones, using the Space Stone to allow the Reality Stone to move Titan's moon before using the Power Stone to crush the moon to pieces and finally used the Space Stone again to pull the pieces to the planet, causing a shower of meteors to rain down upon the heroes.
 battles Doctor Strange]]
Thanos and Doctor Strange then dueled, with Thanos using the Gauntlet to fire a beam of energy using the Power Stone and then infused the Power Stone's energy into the Gauntlet to destroy Doctor Strange's use of the Mirror Dimension, after which he unleashed a black hole with the broken shards from the destruction of the Mirror Dimension upon the sorcerer using the Space Stone, which Strange transmuted into butterflies. Strange then created numerous duplicates of himself, which Thanos eliminated by identifying the real Strange with the Soul Stone and then used the Power Stone to destroy the copies. With Strange briefly distracted by the feedback from the elimination of his clones, Thanos then used the Space and Reality Stones to pull Strange to himself, grabbing him in a choke hold once he was close enough.
 takes possession of the Time Stone]]
Iron Man saved Strange and then battled Thanos one-on-one, after using some of his suit's nanotechnology to force Thanos' hand open with a clamp to stop him from closing his fist, but the warlord's natural strength and rage allowed him to rip the device off easily, regaining the ability to use the Gauntlet. The two dueled briefly and Thanos easily won the fight, but before the Titan could finish Stark off, Strange bartered the Time Stone for Stark's life. With his prize secured, Thanos left for Earth.
 completes the Infinity Gauntlet]]
Arriving in Wakanda, Thanos used the five Stones to quickly dispatch his foes: confining Bruce Banner, clad in the Mark XLVIII armor, within solid rock with the Space Stone, knocking away Captain America, Winter Soldier and Okoye with the Power Stone; restraining Black Widow with the Reality Stone; destroying Falcon's wings and bringing him down with the Space Stone; crushing War Machine with the Space Stone; and blocking Wanda Maximoff's attempt to hold him back with the Space Stone; and undoing Vision and the Mind Stone's destruction with the Time Stone.
 initiates the Snap]]
Seizing Vision, Thanos tore the Mind Stone from Vision's skull and completed the Infinity Gauntlet. However, as he was relishing his success, he was struck by Thor's lightning. Thanos retaliated by firing an energy beam using the combined power of all the Stones, but Thor enchanted Stormbreaker with all his power and the weapon easily sliced through the beam and impaled Thanos in the chest. However, in spite of his wound, Thanos retained enough strength to snap his fingers, activating the Gauntlet, and eradicated half of all life in the universe.
 ]]
The sheer energy required for such a feat nearly overwhelmed him in his weakened state and cast Thanos' soul inside the Soul Stone, where he conversed with a young Gamora. The effort also severely damaged the Infinity Gauntlet itself, making any further use of the stones in battle a potential risk. Once he recovered from the powerful feedback of the Snap, Thanos observed the damaged Gauntlet momentarily before transporting himself to an alien farmland with the Space Stone, resting and enjoying the sunrise as he stated he would once he accomplished his life-long mission to eliminate half of all life in the universe. 

### Destruction of the Infinity Stones

 
Several weeks after the Snap, Thanos, knowing that the Infinity Stones would only tempt him into a lust for power and acknowledging that the Avengers would target them, used their power on themselves to destroy them to prevent anyone from using them to undo the Snap. The energy wave released from the act, along with ravaging Thanos' left side, destroyed the already-damaged Gauntlet and fused its charred remains to Thanos' arm.

### Ambush on Thanos

 's severed arm]]
Two days after Thanos destroyed the Infinity Stones, the Avengers ambushed him in his farm's shack, having tracked the energy surge caused by him doing so. After Captain Marvel, Bruce Banner, and War Machine restrained him, Thor used Stormbreaker to cut off Thanos' left hand, only for Rocket to discover that the Stones were missing from the slots on the Gauntlet's ruined scraps. Once Thanos revealed that he had destroyed them, an enraged Thor killed him by beheading him. With all hope of undoing the Snap seemingly gone, the Avengers left the planet, leaving Thanos's chopped-up corpse and the charred Gauntlet remains in his shack.

## Capabilities

 
 examines the completed Infinity Gauntlet]]
The Infinity Gauntlet was a weapon specifically made to allow the wielder to channel the powers of all six Infinity Stones. With precise control and a single gesture, the wielder is able to use the Stones' powers both individually and together in specific combinations to achieve desired effects, ranging from two Stones at once, to all six in unison. Fully completed with all six Infinity Stones, the Infinity Gauntlet is able to achieve feats on a universal scale, such as wiping out half of all life in the Universe with the snap of the wielder's fingers. When integrated and not in use, the Stones remain in an inactive darkened state, as opposed to their constant glow outside the Gauntlet, and individually light up only when the user specifically invokes their powers with the Gauntlet.

Activating the Gauntlet requires the use of a specific hand gesture (and occasionally, further arm motions depending on the specific feat) - using the Stones individually, in combinations fewer than six, or using the Stones for minor feats appears to only require the wielder to clench the Gauntlet into a fist, while using all six Stones in unison for larger, universal feats requires the more complex gesture of snapping the Gauntlet's fingers. This is a key flaw that can be exploited in combat, as restraining the wielder's Gauntlet hand prevents them from using the Stones' power entirely. 

Activating the Stones further imparts a physical toll on the user, with the physical effort required being roughly commensurate with the scale of the intended feat. For example, using the Stones for minor effects such as energy blasts or teleportation requires no visible effort from Thanos. However, larger feats such as destroying Titan's moon and pulling its fragments across space to rain on Titan's surface causes Thanos to visibly struggle, both clenching his fist and using his Gauntlet arm to "pull" the shattered fragments through space, as if dragging a large weight with one arm. Even a more complex act such as using the Time Stone to reverse the destruction of the Mind Stone causes Thanos to visibly exert himself. 

The Stones seem to be attracted towards the Gauntlet by design; the wielder has only to hold a Stone over an empty slot, whereupon the Stone fuses to it automatically. Integrating a new Stone into the Gauntlet channels its energy into the weapon and through the wielder immediately in a sudden and painful power surge. As such, the Gauntlet's wearer must possess a substantially high level of mental fortitude and physical strength, capable of withstanding the severe strain caused by adding even just one Infinity Stone. The most severe surge occurs when the Gauntlet is fully completed with all six Stones, channelling the energy of all six Stones into the wielder's body in streaks of colored energy. 

As a weapon made entirely of Uru, the Infinity Gauntlet is tremendously durable, able to withstand both having all six Infinity Stones embedded into it, and the general usage of their powers. This durability allows it to sustain attacks in regular combat unscathed, such as from Captain Marvel's photon blasts, even in a damaged state. It is even able to be used in basic melee combat to great effect, such as during Thanos' duel with the Hulk. 

However, when using the power of all six Stones at once for full-scale universal feats, the immense surge of energy is enough to burn the Gauntlet itself, causing heavy damage to both it and its wielder's body. After the Snap, both the Gauntlet and Thanos' left arm are left severely burned and damaged, with the Gauntlet itself still remaining in a functional and useable state. Damage inflicted by such uses is irreparable even with the Stones' power, as while Thanos was able to heal his chest wound from Stormbreaker immediately after, he is unable to repair the burns sustained to his Gauntlet arm or the Gauntlet itself. 

Even in a heavily damaged state, the Infinity Gauntlet could still perform a second full-scale use of the six Infinity Stones - when Thanos utilized it again to destroy the Infinity Stones themselves. This second usage reduced it to a charred husk, though the Gauntlet's remains roughly retain its former shape, and further permanent damage is inflicted to the wielder by this - with Thanos' burns extending up from his left arm to the left side of his neck and face, crippling his entire left side with a constant limp, and permanently fusing the Gauntlet's remains to his left arm. As this second full-scale usage destroyed the Stones, it's unknown if the Gauntlet's fried remains retain functionality in their current state.

## Trivia

*In the comics, the Infinity Gauntlet was originally a glove from Thanos' own armor modified to house the individual Infinity Gems. In the movies, the Infinity Gauntlet was specifically forged at Thanos' demand, and does not match the armor seen on his right hand when worn.
*Due to the Infinity Stones receiving different colors from the original Infinity Gems seen in previous media, the color setup of the Infinity Gauntlet from the movies differs from the color configuration originally seen in the comics.
*The Infinity Stones that are shown in the Gauntlet in Odin's Vault are fakes created by Asgardians, presumably to show how the item is supposed to look, like a museum piece, although the order of the Stones is vastly different from Thanos' order or the original comic configuration.
*Each stone's visual effects are unique, for example; when using the Time Stone, Thanos (just like Doctor Strange) had green rings resembling Strange's circular energy shielding encircle his arm, but while using the Power Stone, Thanos' fist would glow purple.
*How the Infinity Gauntlet actually utilises the power of the Infinity Stones is never fully explained. The only information given on how the Gauntlet functions is that, due to the flaw intentionally built in by Eitri, one must first clench their fist to use the Gauntlet, after which the Stones activate and glow depending on which one(s) the user is interested in or actively using: whether it is one Stone at a time, one Stone in conjunction with another, or all of the Stones at once.

## Behind the Scenes

*The Infinity Gauntlet prop from Thor was showcased at Comic-Con 2010, while Josh Brolin entered the stage wearing a fake Infinity Gauntlet glove at Comic-Con 2014.
*After the release of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige confirmed that in the Marvel Cinematic Universe there were two Infinity Gauntlets and that the one Thanos retrieved was not in Odin's Vault. The Big Secret Behind The Infinity Gauntlet, According To Marvel's Kevin Feige Feige later elaborated after the release of Thor: Ragnarok that when the fake Infinity Gauntlet was included in the first Thor film, Marvel Studios had yet to start planning an adaptation of Jim Starlin's Infinity Gauntlet, so it was included as an Easter egg. Feige also stated that they have a theory that Odin created the fake gauntlet to deceive his enemies, fully knowing the dangers the real Infinity Gauntlet posed. Kevin Feige Answers Your Lingering ‘Thor: Ragnarok’ Spoiler Questions 
*When asked how Stormbreaker could overpower the power of the completed Infinity Gauntlet, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely suggest that Eitri is responsible because of his "Dwarven magic": He made both items and made it so that Stormbreaker is able to defeat the Infinity Gauntlet. Infinity War Spoilers: Screenwriters Go In-Depth on Making of Film 
*Regarding the Snap, Christopher Markus has stated that the immense amount of energy of using all six Infinity Stones at once would kill anyone who attempts it, even with the Infinity Gauntlet, and "the strongest being in the universe has to be the one to do it," referring to Thanos.
