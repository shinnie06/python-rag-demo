Harold Joseph "Happy" Hogan is the Head of Security of Stark Industries, and was one of Tony Stark's closest friends. A former boxer, he was employed by Stark as a personal chauffeur and bodyguard and assisted him in taking down Ivan Vanko. Hogan was almost killed during Aldrich Killian's war, which motivated Stark to seek out the Mandarin, who he believed was behind Hogan's injuries. After his recovery, Hogan continued to serve as Stark's friend and employee.

Hogan oversaw Stark's mentorship over Peter Parker as Spider-Man, aiding the young hero on his trip to Germany and acting as their liaison when Parker continued his superhero activities. Initially irritated by the boy and avoiding him, Hogan grew to respect Parker when he delivered Vulture to justice, as he targeted a cargo plane under Hogan's direct supervision that was carrying equipment for the Avengers Compound.

In 2023, Hogan was present at Stark's funeral. The following year, he helped Spider-Man deal with Mysterio and the Elementals in Europe. When Parker became victim to public hostility after he was framed for murdering Mysterio, Hogan allowed him and May to use his condo. Hogan also hired Matt Murdock to defend him after he was investigated by Damage Control due to the Stark Industries drones used during the Battle of London. Later, Hogan was ridden with grief by May's murder and had his memories of Parker erased by Doctor Strange.

## Biography

 

### Tony Stark's Bodyguard

#### Employed by Tony Stark

 
Harold Hogan was a former boxer who was hired by Tony Stark to be his personal chauffeur and bodyguard after his boxing career ended. I Am Iron Man: Behind the Scenes Making of Iron Man Stark gave him the nickname of "Happy" due to his typically glum personality. 

#### New Year's in Switzerland

 
 ]]
On New Year's Eve in 1999, Hogan accompanied Stark to Bern, Switzerland on his first and only date with Maya Hansen. Hogan stayed with Stark as he made his way through the party after the Bern 2000, being introduced to Ho Yinsen and Doctor Wu. When they made it to the elevator, Hogan tried and failed to keep an eccentric scientist named Aldrich Killian away from Stark and Hansen as he attempted to gain Stark's investment for A.I.M.
 and Maya Hansen]]
Hogan escorted Stark and Hansen back to her hotel room, where they discussed her experiments with a virus which would allow the human body to instantly regenerate damaged tissue, even severed limbs. Hogan was skeptical and fiddled with an experimental plant, breaking off a stem. As he prepared to leave, the plant exploded, causing Hogan to instinctively react by jumping on Stark to protect him. When the situation was explained, Hogan wished Stark and Hansen a Happy New Year before leaving them alone for the night. 

#### Kidnapping of Tony Stark

 enjoy some gambling]]
 
In 2008, Hogan accompanied Stark to Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for an awards ceremony, although Stark decided not to attend and instead spent his time gambling and flirting with the girls in the club. They were interrupted by Stark's friend James Rhodes who handed Stark his award and berated him for missing the ceremony. As they exited the casino, they were stopped by Christine Everhart who interviewed Stark about his company. Stark charmed Everhart and Hogan drove them both back to his mansion.
 to his private jet]]
The next morning, Hogan followed Stark to the Stark Industries Aviation Division in a , but had trouble keeping up with him as Stark drove the faster . Stark flew to Afghanistan where he demonstrated the Jericho before being kidnapped by the terrorist organization Ten Rings. Three months later, Stark was found walking across the desert by James Rhodes, having escaped from the Ten Rings himself.
 ]]
Upon Stark's return to the United States of America, Hogan drove Pepper Potts to the airport to meet Stark and then drove them back to Stark Industries to meet Obadiah Stane, after stopping to get cheeseburgers for Stark per his request. Hogan was present when Stark gave a press conference about his experience, where he also announced he would be shutting down the weapons manufacturing section of Stark Industries. 

#### Protecting Iron Man

 ]]
 
With Tony Stark having admitted to being the superhero Iron Man, Hogan's job became more difficult as Stark gained mass popularity, and developed a vast fan following. After a Stark Expo presentation, Hogan escorted Stark through the sea of people looking to gain his attention whilst introducing figures of interest. When the pair finally made it outside, they found a beautiful U.S. Marshal waiting for them. She informed Stark that he had been issued a subpoena to appear in Washington, D.C. before a U.S. Congressional committee headed by Senator Stern. Hogan took the subpoena and drove them to D.C. 

#### Boxing Training

 ]]
 
Hogan continued to work closely with Tony Stark and the two developed a close friendship. They often boxed together to keep fit, although Stark would often cheat during their fights, using mixed martial arts (MMA) techniques to elbow Hogan in the face or kick him in the chest, much to his annoyance.
 ]]
One day while training, they were interrupted by Natalie Rushman, a legal representative from Stark Industries as Pepper Potts had been promoted to CEO. Stark asked Hogan to show Rushman how to box; he agreed and teased her about the unlikelihood of her having any real training. However, Hogan quickly learned that Rushman was more than she seemed when she effortlessly blocked a punch and threw him painfully to the floor in a scissoring technique, to which Stark mocked Hogan. 

#### Duel of Monaco

 ]]
 
During the Circuit de Monaco, Hogan accompanied Tony Stark, Pepper Potts and Natalie Rushman, keeping the Mark V suitcase armor handcuffed to his wrist. When Stark entered the race himself, taking over his own formula one racing car, he was soon attacked by terrorist Ivan Vanko, using a recreated Arc Reactor-powered suit with electric whips. Hogan risked his life in trying to get the Suitcase Armor to Stark, driving into the race one-handed while Potts unlocked its handcuff.
 from Ivan Vanko]]
Hogan drove down the wrong way of the track and slammed Vanko against the fencing. Stark yelled at Hogan for nearly hitting him in the crash and tried to enter the car. However, Vanko recovered and attacked the car with his whips, ripping it apart and nearly hitting Hogan and Potts. They managed to give Stark the armor and he was able to use it to defeat Vanko after a brief but brutal fight. Hogan and Potts then watched as Vanko was taken away by the police, taunting Stark that he had lost. 

#### Trouble Continues

 ]]
Tony Stark hosted a birthday party in his Mansion, proceeding to get drunk and wear one of his Iron Man suits to impress his guests. This action angered James Rhodes, who had been defending Stark to the government, so he put on another suit and confronted Stark. The two friends began fighting throughout the Mansion and when the destruction neared Pepper Potts, Hogan quickly ran inside to pull her to safety. The duel ended with great damage to the mansion and Rhodes leaving with the Iron Man suit.
 ' office]]
Back at Stark Industries the next day, Hogan went to collect Potts for her upcoming meeting and found her talking with Stark. He asked if Potts needed anything else and Stark tried to answer, believing the question was directed at him, when he realized that Hogan was working for Potts now. Stark tried to make an awkward joke, but an upset Hogan advised him to stop talking. He and Potts then left the office while Stark spoke to Natalie Rushman. 

#### Raid of Hammer Industries

 changing]]
 
Hogan became Pepper Potts' bodyguard when she was named CEO of Stark Industries, and accompanied her to the Stark Expo. During the Battle at Stark Expo, he was unable to reach Potts and soon approached by Natasha Romanoff, who demanded to get to the Hammer Industries Headquarters in order to stop Ivan Vanko's attack on the Expo. Hogan was wary, but agreed to drive her there. On the way as Romanoff discussed strategy, he could not help but try to look as she changed clothes in the back of the car.
 ]]
When they arrived at the facility, Hogan insisted on helping Romanoff with her mission, as he started to fight the first bodyguard they encountered. After a long scuffle, Hogan resorted to using the dirty boxing tactics he had learned from Tony Stark to knock the guard unconscious. Pleased with his efforts, Hogan called out to Romanoff, only to see she had defeated every other guard in the building. He then stood by Romanoff as she hacked into the Hammer Industries computer and returned control of the War Machine Armor to James Rhodes so they could join forces and fight back against Vanko. 

### Head of Security

#### Spying on Aldrich Killian

 on his new job]]
 
Hogan soon became very uncomfortable with his role as Tony Stark aka Iron Man's bodyguard, which he was often ridiculed for. He was subsequently granted a new position as the head of security in the corporate headquarters of Stark Industries, a role which Hogan took great pride in despite causing staff complaints to rise to a shocking level due to his unrelenting insistence on following protocol. It was in this capacity that Hogan encountered Eric Savin and his boss, Aldrich Killian, when they visited Stark Industries for a meeting with Pepper Potts. Hogan checked Killian's credentials and recognized him from the Bern 2000.
 about Aldrich Killian]]
Hogan then received a call from Stark and struggled to answer the tablet, annoyed at being interrupted at work. He revealed Potts was meeting and possibly flirting with Killian, trying to explain how the latter was showing off his "big brain." The two discussed Hogan's new position and Stark mocked his lack of skill with technology. Hogan planned to follow Killian and Savin, suspicious of their intentions. As the pair said goodbye, Hogan noted that he had barely seen Stark since his friend started working with the Avengers.

Later after arranging for Potts' car, Hogan took a picture of Killian and Savin's vehicle as they drove away in order to run their plates. 

#### Destruction of the Chinese Theatre

 ]]
 
Immediately suspicious, Hogan investigated and later followed Eric Savin to an exchange with another man at the TCL Chinese Theatre. He decided to interfere and gather evidence upon noticing some of the man's flesh glowing in an amber hue. After purposefully bumping into the man to make him drop his package, Hogan covertly took one of the capsules the man had been given. Before he could leave, Hogan was confronted by Savin, who tried to steal back the device.
 
Hogan attempted to defend himself and punched Savin in the face. Much to his horror though, Savin's wound healed immediately with the same golden glow, and he violently attacked Hogan. Their altercation was interrupted when the other man exploded, killing several people and severely injuring Hogan. He was able to point to the man's dog tags, a vital piece of evidence, before lapsing into unconsciousness; an act that gave Tony Stark a valuable clue into the cause of the explosion. 

#### Recovery

 ]]
 . That's his show, he thinks it's elegant. One more thing, make sure everyone wears their badges. He's a stickler for that sort of thing.|Tony Stark|Iron Man 3}}
Hogan was rendered comatose and admitted to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital. Tony Stark stayed by his friend's bedside and asked the nurse to put on the television, as it was Hogan's favorite show, and ensure that all the staff wore their security badges, since it would annoy Hogan to find out they were not. This incident prompted Stark to publicly threaten the Mandarin, who was responsible for the attack. Hogan ultimately woke up, days after the explosion, to Downton Abbey and was attended to by a nurse. 

### Escorting Peter Parker

 
 
In 2016, Hogan was still employed at Stark Industries, continuing to be the Head of Security but aspiring to be promoted to asset management. After Tony Stark recruited Peter Parker to assist in the fight between his team and Steve Rogers's team, Hogan was tasked with bringing Parker to Germany. Hogan picked Parker up and brought him on the Stark private plane.
 
Once in Berlin, Hogan took Parker to their hotel, neighbored with him, and introduced him to the new suit designed for him by Stark. While staying at the hotel, Hogan was billed for an expensive movie Parker had ordered, and believed the price meant it was an adult film. Hogan then drove Parker to the Leipzig-Halle Airport and picked him up afterwards. Later, Hogan had to chastise Parker for being too loud in the hotel room, as the walls were thin.
 ]]
Hogan then took Parker back to New York City in the jet plane and met up with Stark, who rode back with them to Parker's apartment complex. Hogan got Parker's suitcase out of the trunk, watched Parker leave, and drove off with Stark. 

### Worrying about Tony Stark

 
As time progressed, Tony Stark got increasingly obsessive over his new Iron Man armor, and Hogan got worried that Stark was not eating. He brought fast food for him and tried to get Stark to eat, but Stark could not be convinced. Hogan put the fast food he got on the table, and Stark showed him the schematics for the latest armor he was designing. Hogan again voiced his concern, but Stark simply stated that if he did not push himself, people would die. Hogan remained quiet to allow Stark to concentrate and eventually asked if he had heard from Steve Rogers, so Stark simply said that he had not. Stark asked Hogan for help, and Hogan asked about Peter Parker, mentioning that he had left ten voicemails for Hogan the previous day. Stark tested his gauntlet, which crushed a cinder block into ash, and said it needed work. Hogan sarcastically agreed, so the two went for a walk, where Stark told Hogan that he wanted to keep track of the Avengers more so they could be prepared for future threats. They briefly talked about Stark's attempt to lift Mjølnir, when Stark asked Hogan to contact whomever he could. Hogan commented on how weird the world was, and Stark agreed, noting how much more advanced Asgardian technology was and wanting to match their level.

Later that day, Hogan contacted Stark to remind him of the satellite launch which Stark was meant to attend with Maria Hill. While driving Stark to the launch, Hogan asked why Stark was suddenly interested in space, so Stark explained that the satellite would launch nano-satellites into space to detect anything. Hogan watched the launch with Stark and Hill, but was unimpressed. Stark told Hill that the nano-satellites would take a month to reach their positions, and the two discussed Stark's hope of not finding anything. 

### Asset Management

#### Monitoring Spider-Man

 ]]
 
Two months later, Hogan had been promoted to asset management as requested and was assigned to oversee the removal of all items and technology from Avengers Tower after Stark sold the building to move to the Avengers Compound in upstate New York. Hogan was also Parker's primary contact as he started his crime-fighting career, and duly relayed all of Parker's messages to Stark. 

Soon after, Hogan went to the Compound on a weekend and found Stark monitoring his nano-satellites alone. He gave Stark takeout and explained that he felt Stark needed company. He told Stark that after talking to Parker, he believed the young hero's heart to be in the right place. The pair watched the monitor together, and Hogan used his fork to emulate the sound of the satellites pinging, which Stark and Hogan both laughed at. Stark stepped outside to take a call, and Hogan tried on the gauntlet to one of Stark's Iron Man armors, quickly hiding them behind his back as Stark returned. Stark expressed surprise that Hogan waited as long as he did to try them on and agreed with Hogan that they were heavier than they appeared. 

#### Hijacking of the Stark Cargo Plane

 ]]
 
On moving day, Hogan oversaw the loading of all of the items due to be moved onto the cargo plane. He was contacted by Parker's friend Ned Leeds, who tried to warn him that the plane was in danger, but he brushed off the warning. After seeing it off, the plane was hijacked by Vulture and subsequently crashed on Coney Island after Spider-Man intervened.
 ]]
Hogan accompanied the FBI to the crash site where they found Toomes webbed and restrained on the side of a car, with a note from Spider-Man reading: "Found the Flying Vulture Guy. P.S. Sorry about your plane." Hogan watched as the federal agents arrested Toomes for his failed robbery, with Hogan earning a newfound respect and admiration for Spider-Man. 

#### Parker's Rejection

 in private]]
 
Days later, Hogan appeared at Parker's school to personally apologize for not listening to his warnings, and to thank him for saving his job. He then took Parker on a ride to the Avengers Compound where Tony Stark intended to announce Spider-Man to the world as the newest official member of the Avengers. However, Parker declined the invitation and left the building to wait in the car for a ride home. As he left, Hogan expressed to Stark that Parker was a "good kid."
 ]]
Pepper Potts then reminded Hogan and Stark that there was a room full of press expecting an announcement; Stark asked Hogan if he was still carrying an engagement ring, and intended to give them it. However, Potts was somewhat confused by the tactic and assured the two that she would think of something better. Despite Potts' word, Hogan tossed the ring to Stark as a last-case measure. 

#### Interviewing Wade Wilson

 ]]
 
On March 14, 2018, Hogan interviewed Wade Wilson at the Avengers Compound. When Hogan asked Wilson what he was wanting, he answered that he wanted to matter, although Wilson wondered if Tony Stark would be joining them. Hogan explained that he was in charge of the meeting, as Stark was too busy for entry-level matters. Wilson was confused, thinking that Hogan was only Stark's chauffeur, so Hogan explained that he started as Stark's driver and moved up to head of security.
 's application]]
Hogan continued the interview, asking about Wilson's team experience in , which did not give Hogan confidence in Wilson. Seeing the interview failing, Wilson expressed his desire to join the Avengers, saying he needed it. Hogan told Wilson that the Avengers did what they do because others needed them, and included himself as part of the team, which Wilson questioned. Hogan then ended the interview, rejecting Wilson's application, and he told him to find a place where he can thrive. Two months later, the Snap occurred, wiping out half of all humanity, although Hogan survived. 

#### Tony Stark's Funeral

 's final message]]
 
In 2023, Hogan, along with Pepper Potts, Morgan Stark, James Rhodes, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Clint Barton and Thor watched Tony Stark's recording at the Stark Eco-Compound that he made in preparation for the possibility that he would not survive the mission.
 comfort each other]]
Hogan then went outside to the lake, where the rest of the Avengers and their allies were standing. He and Rhodes comforted each other, both being very close to Stark, as they watched Potts and Morgan place Stark's Arc Reactor on the lake.
 ]]
Afterwards, Hogan sat with Morgan by the house and asked her if she was hungry. She replied that she wanted cheeseburgers. An emotional Hogan smiled, telling her that her father liked cheeseburgers as well, and promised to get her all the cheeseburgers she wanted. Following this, Hogan was given possession of Dum-E. 

### Mysterio's Masquerade

#### Flirting with May Parker

 a large check]]
 
In 2024, Hogan went to a charity event for people displaced by the Blip in New York City to see Peter Parker. When Hogan arrived, he was greeted by Parker and May Parker. He then presented May with a large check from Pepper Potts before he began flirting with May by complimenting her about her hair and asking her about her new dress, to which she responded to commenting about his beard.
 ]]
When May left, Parker asked Hogan what happened, but he ignored him and told him that Nick Fury was calling him. Hogan told Parker that Fury calls superheroes for any activities. When Parker's phone started ringing, Hogan told Parker that that was Fury calling him, but he reluctantly refused to speak to him but told Parker to answer the phone or else he will have to.
 's calls]]
When Parker hung up on Fury, Hogan freaked out and strongly advised against "ghosting" Fury. Parker then told Hogan that he had to go as he noticed the crowd of people calling him backstage. He promised Hogan that he'll call Fury later on. Once Parker left, Hogan immediately received a call from Fury, whom he tried to reassure that Parker was not "ghosting" him. 

#### Helping at Salvation Army

 's lunch]]
 
Later, after Parker left for a school trip to Europe, Hogan and May began a momentarily relationship. One day, while the two were at a restaurant, May called Parker to ask him about the recent battle in the Grand Canal. As she did this, Happy ate May's food, to which she told him not to eat her lunch.
 ]]
May then briefly gave the call to Hogan so he could say hi to Parker, though he didn't really want to say hi to him, he did it anyway. Hogan then told a suspicious Parker that he was simply helping May and taking care of her, though Parker did not believe it. 

#### Advising Peter Parker

 ]]
 
Days later, Hogan was called by Peter Parker, who told Hogan to pick him up in the Netherlands as he was stranded there. Once he arrived at Parker's location in a Stark Industries Private Jet, Parker asked if he was really Hogan, much to his confusion. Parker then demanded Hogan to prove he's himself by telling him something only the real Happy would know. Hogan then proved this by revealing that he knew about Parker renting a presumably R-rated movie while at the hotel in Germany in 2016. Parker then hugged Hogan, who asked for an explanation on what was happening with him.
 discuss Tony Stark]]
Upon entering the plane, Parker told him that he was nearly killed by Quentin Beck, an illusionist who was using illusions of powerful creatures to make the world think he was a new hero, and who fooled Parker into giving him E.D.I.T.H., an AI created by Tony Stark with control over hundreds of drones, as well as into revealing who of Parker's friends know about his plot. As Hogan gave first aid to Parker, the latter yelled at Hogan on how he failed to stop Beck's plan. After Parker calmed down and opened up about how he feels unable to live up to Stark's legacy, Hogan comforted Peter by telling him that not even Stark could live up to his own legacy, but revealed that picking Parker as his protégé was the only decision Stark never regretted or second-guessed. Hogan felt that Stark wouldn't have sacrificed himself if he didn't know that Parker would survive to continue his work.
 making his suit]]
A motivated Parker then instructed Hogan to give him his phone so he could know where Beck's plan was going to happen, which he discovered was in London. Hogan then proudly watched as Peter created a new Spider-Man suit with Stark technology, before playing AC/DC's " ," and piloting the plane. Before fighting Beck, Hogan tried to sent Nick Fury a coded message warning him of Beck's deception, but, unbeknownst to Hogan, Fury didn't realize it was a message. Hogan then asked Parker about his battle plan, which he explained to Hogan, before asking Hogan to give Michelle Jones a Black Dahlia necklace he bought for her in case Parker was killed-in-action. 

#### Battle of London

 jump off the plane]]
 
Upon arriving in London, Hogan saw the illusion that Mysterio's drones generated and was shocked by its realism and even asked Parker if it's really fake, which he confirmed. Before jumping off the plane in his new suit, Parker told Hogan that they would have to talk about his and May's relationship later.
 's classmates]]
After landing the plane, Hogan found Parker's friends, Ned Leeds, Michelle Jones, Betty Brant, and Flash Thompson, through Thompson's social media videos. He then introduced himself to them and told them to come with him. However, one of the drones destroyed their plane in order to prevent them from escaping.
 ]]
Hogan then instructed the students to hide inside the vault of the Royal Crown Jewels. While entering the vault, Hogan and the kids were forced to escape from a drone that followed them. As Hogan and the kids entered the vault, he desperately tried to throw a shield at the drone, only to fail, causing him to wonder how Captain America could do it with his own shield.
 ]]
Once inside, as the drone started shooting missiles at the vault, Hogan and the kids, believing it to be their final moments, openly admitted several of their secrets. Hogan confessed that he was in love with Spider-Man's aunt, much to Jones, Leeds, Brant, and Thompson's surprise. Once the shooting ended, Hogan and the kids realized that Parker had been successful in stopping the drones and left the vault. 

### Spider-Man Controversy

#### Returning to New York

 and Peter Parker]]
 
Back in New York City, Hogan met with May at the Parker Residence and Peter Parker demanded an explanation from them about their relationship. May described it as a fling, whereas Hogan said that he thought they had a long-term connection. Parker would leave to go on his own date while leaving Hogan and May alone. 
 broke up with him]]
They would later get intimate, but citing boundaries, May quickly decided to break off the relationship, much to Hogan's distress. As she led him out the door of the apartment, they heard a noise coming from within. Despite May telling him it was okay, Hogan came back inside and went to where the noise came from, opening a bedroom door seeing Parker and Michelle Jones, having entered through Parker's bedroom window.
 and Michelle Jones]]
Noticing that Parker was undressed, Hogan stepped back in surprise and waited until May came and saw to him. Hogan then went with them into the living room and Parker demanded them explain their relationship, before they saw on the television that NY1 was reporting on Parker's identity as Spider-Man. WLGJ helicopters then were seen hovering and they realized that the footage was live. Parker then used his Web-Shooters to close the windows, but opened one again to show May that the helicopters were outside their building. 

### Legal Troubles

#### Meeting with Matt Murdock

 
 . What did they say in Goodfellas?|Happy Hogan to Matt Murdock|Spider-Man: No Way Home}}
Hogan watched as NY1 continued stating that the United States Department of Damage Control had taken charge of the investigation and that due to the drones being made by Stark Industries, Hogan would be investigated, with Hogan commenting on the picture they chose to use for him. Hogan then left the Parker Residence to let Peter Parker and May Parker have time together.
 ]]
A few days later, Hogan returned to the apartment to be present for the meeting with Parker, May, and Parker's lawyer, Matt Murdock. Murdock told Parker he was able to clear him of the legal charges, cut the things weren't all the way good yet. He then told Hogan that he would be investigated due to his status in Stark Industries, and advised he seek immediate legal protection. 

#### Living with the Parkers

 and Peter Parker into his condominium]]
 ?|Happy Hogan to Peter Parker and May Parker|Spider-Man: No Way Home}}
Following this, May Parker stated they needed a safer place to live and Hogan offered them to stay at his condominium on Long Island. Hogan welcomed May and Parker to his condominium and asked Parker if he liked Donkey Kong, while Dum-E greeted them. After they got settled in, Hogan gave his bed to May and chose to sleep in a lounge chair in his living room.
 
One night, Peter Parker, who was designated to sleep on the couch, was video-calling Michelle Jones and became too loud in their conversation. Irritated, Hogan told Peter to end the call so he could get some sleep. 

### Spider-Man Multiversal Crisis

#### Interrogated by Damage Control

 ]]
 
As he was being investigated for the Stark Industries Combat Drones used during the Battle of London, Hogan hired Matt Murdock to be his attorney. Murdock represented Hogan during an interrogation with the United States Department of Damage Control. However, Hogan was too nervous and distracted to concentrate on the questions, as he witnessed a group of suspicious men entering his apartment, invited by Peter Parker and May Parker. Aware that Hogan had started sweating, Murdock urged him to stop, prompting Hogan to ask how he could do that. 

#### Condo Destruction

 ]]
 
Hogan drove back from the deposition and called Peter Parker from his vehicle. Upon being put to voicemail, Hogan left a message inquiring as to why he had brought strange men, including one with robot legs and a man made of mud, into his apartment. Hogan then asked Parker to call him back before disconnecting the call.
 has been killed]]
Hogan arrived at his condominium, only to find it destroyed with smoke and fires around the area. He rolled down his passenger side window and saw Parker, who was emotional and battle weary, holding onto May's lifeless body. Hogan became distraught at what had happened.
 ]]
However, he was then forcibly taken out of his car by the United States Department of Damage Control agents on the scene. As he was being taken into custody, Hogan yelled out to Parker to run before Damage Control's SWAT team began to open fire. 
 

#### Losing May

 's grave]]
 
Shortly afterwards, Hogan, along with the rest of his universe, had his memory of Peter Parker erased. In December, he went solemnly to May Parker's gravesite and saw a young man there as well and asked how he knew May. He replied it was due to Spider-Man, in which Hogan said the same for him. He then recalled losing Tony Stark a year ago, saying that it felt the same losing May, although a little different. The young man reassured him that he knew things would get better. He and the young man then exchanged their goodbyes and wished each other well. 

## Abilities

 
*Combatant: Hogan was a former professional boxer and occasionally sparred with Tony Stark. Hogan learned to use mixed martial arts from his sparring with Stark and, with considerable effort, was able to defeat a professional security guard of Hammer Industries. Hogan was also able to cause enough damage to Eric Savin's face with just one punch to the point where the latter had to heal the damage for several seconds with his Extremis powers.
*Pilot: Hogan is a capable pilot able to fly the Stark Industries Private Jet, having it at his disposal when having to rescue Peter Parker at the Netherlands.

## Equipment

### Vehicles

* : One of Tony Stark's luxury cars, which Happy drove to chauffeur Stark and Pepper Potts. In Monaco, it was sliced in half by Whiplash's electrical whips.
*Stark Industries Private Jet: Happy used the Stark Industries Private Jet to assist Peter Parker after he became stranded in the Netherlands. After he succeeded, Hogan would then fly Parker to London as he constructed a new Spider-Man suit aboard the jet. Shortly after landing, Hogan attempted to fly Parker's friends away to safety within the jet, but it was destroyed by drones before they could board.

## Facilities

*Stark Industries Headquarters: Hogan provided security at Stark Industries' headquarters, where he did what he could to keep the company and his boss, Tony Stark, safe.
*Tony Stark's Mansion: As Tony Stark's bodyguard, Happy Hogan spent a great deal of time at Tony Stark's mansion. Occasionally, he would spar with Stark in his boxing ring.
*Cedars-Sinai Hospital: After receiving mortal injuries at the hands of Eric Savin's actions, Hogan slipped into a coma and was kept at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital. Tony Stark visited Hogan and ensured the television show Downton Abbey be played for Hogan should he wake up. Ultimately, Hogan pulled through and watched the show on television as he recovered.
*Avengers Tower: Hogan packed Avengers Tower on Tony Stark's behalf following the sale of the building.
*Avengers Compound: Much like Tony Stark's mansion, Hogan spent a lot of time at the Avengers Compound in the company of Stark. He apparently spent enough time at the compound to become familiar with the behaviour of its inhabitants, as Hogan commented on Vision's habit of phasing through walls into people's rooms unannounced.
*Stark Eco-Compound: Following the death of Tony Stark, Hogan went to Stark's house and watched a recording left by Stark. He attended Stark's funeral and stayed with his daughter, offering her cheeseburgers.
*Parker Residence: Hogan often visited the residence of Peter and May Parker, mostly to visit the latter during their brief fling. 
*Happy Hogan's Condominium: Happy Hogan offered to let Peter and May Parker stay at his apartment in order to hide from the backlash of the public believing Spider-Man, and thus Peter Parker, to be a murderer. Peter eventually used Hogan's apartment as a temporary base, where he could develop individual cures for interdimensional visitors. However, this plan ultimately failed and a battle ensued, damaging Hogan's apartment and several other floors of the building. Hogan later left Peter a voicemail message, asking him who the villains were, confused as to why Peter had let them in.
