Jonathan "Johnny" Storm is the charismatic younger brother of Sue Storm and a founding member of the Fantastic Four dubbed Human Torch for his ability to generate fire from his body. Four years after the team's formation, Storm discovered that his sister and Reed Richards were expecting a son before they were warned by Silver Surfer of Galactus' intent to devour Earth. While the Fantastic Four's attempts to reason with Galactus failed, Storm was able to detect recordings of the many worlds Silver Surfer allowed Galactus to devour, thus learning her native language. When the herald destroyed the Teleportation Bridges built around the world to teleport Earth far away from Galactus, Storm convinced her to turn against her master. As Galactus arrived in New York City to claim Franklin Richards, Storm attempted to sacrifice himself to banish Galactus far into space using the last Teleportation Bridge, although Shalla-Bal stopped him and defeated Galactus herself at the cost of Sue's life. As Sue was eventually resurrected by Franklin, Storm celebrated the victory with his team.

They took off and successfully reached space, but were hit with an unanticipated storm of Cosmic Radiation that penetrated the ship's defenses. As the group of astronauts landed back on Earth, Johnny's body suddenly caught on fire. 

#### Isolation

 
At Reed Richards' insistence, Storm and the other three astronauts isolated themselves within Building Q in the Celestial Cradle in Huntsville, Alabama. They took the time alone to figure out precisely how their new abilities worked while ensuring they were not a danger to everyone else. However, Storm grew bored once he had learned to manage his powers and one day asked Richards when they would be able to leave. Richards insisted that it was not time yet while Ben Grimm got frustrated and attacked a robot designated K.E.R.B.I.E., telling Storm to stop moping. Storm insisted that he was not moping, but rather that he was bored and sad and that he felt life to be meaningless.

However, when Grimm explained that Storm had just described moping, Storm lit himself on fire and explained his frustrations. However, Grimm voiced his own frustrations with his body's physical transformation, leading them to fight physically while Richards tried and failed to separate them. They shouted at each other about the other moping, but Sue Storm cut in and put a forcefield around Johnny and Ben's heads, temporarily preventing them from breathing and making them stop. Sue showed the others video footage of an attack in New York City, shocking Johnny. Grimm and Richards agreed it was time to leave, so they got into a vehicle and left Building Q, flying toward New York. 

### Founding the Fantastic Four

#### Revolt of Subterranea

 
The team arrived in New York City and stepped out of their vehicle, where they were mobbed by reporters. At first, Storm believed someone else famous had arrived, but he soon realized that the reporters were there for him and his friends. Suddenly, the team were confronted by a large monster named Giganto. Storm was briefly distracted by Ben Grimm shouting about clobbering and was worried about making people nervous by using his powers. Reed Richards said that he felt the same way, giving Storm the confidence to light himself on fire and attack Giganto. Sue Storm surrounded Giganto in a forcefield, suffocating him enough to make him go down while Johnny regrouped with the others.

Suddenly, the Pan Am Building fell into the ground, so Johnny Storm and the others went to investigate. They found Harvey Elder leading an attack and confronted him, so Elder had his army attack the team. Storm fought his attackers and warned nearby women to stay away from his flames. Elder saw a pregnant soldier getting attacked and surrendered in exchange for her safety, so Storm stopped fighting and joined the team in taking Elder away. 

#### Rebuilding Subterranea

Sue Storm and Harvey Elder worked to establish peace between Subterranea and the rest of the world, with Johnny Storm and the rest of the team working together to help the Moloids rebuild their society. The team hosted Elder and several others at a large dinner, which Storm enjoyed. 

#### Ribbon Cutting

The team, now known as the Fantastic Four, began working together regularly and established the Baxter Building as their base of operations. They held a ribbon cutting ceremony, during which Storm burned the ribbon to cut it. The team then celebrated their new building, while Storm teased Ben Grimm for his catchphrase of "It's clobberin' time." 

#### Fame

 
The Flaming Hearts Fan Club was established as a fan club specifically about Storm. He was interviewed by the fan club's magazine and said that, as much as he appreciated his fans, he worried about letting them down. In an interview with Tommy Hanson of Fantastic Fans, Storm expressed his confusion at the publicity surrounding his arrival in New York City the day of the Revolt of Subterranea. During this time, Storm began playing golf and played with several big names, finding it relaxing as he became skilled at the game.

He was later interviewed by Teen Living, during which he said that the rest of the Fantastic Four kept him grounded. He also shared that he kept a large vinyl collection at the Baxter Building and passed his sister's advice to be true to oneself onto Teen Living ' s readers. When asked his favorite way to relax, he answered listening to music and being with his family. He said that he liked spontaneous dates and that the Fantastic Four were his biggest inspiration. He was asked what he would be doing if not with the Fantastic Four, to which Storm said he would likely be working with cars, adding that, as a hidden talent, he enjoyed acting. He said that the hardest part of being in the spotlight was the lack of privacy and that he did not have a strict fitness routine. He said that Ben Grimm's food was his favorite meal and advised his fans to never give up and to stay true to themselves. He expressed hope that in ten years he would be acting and still with the Fantastic Four. 

Inspired by the interview, a fan named Jimmy wrote a letter to Storm, which Storm received, asking about Storm's favorite food and if he liked watching movies, whether his sister was annoying, whether he ever accidentally set himself on fire, and several other questions, inviting Storm to listen to his father's record collection with him.
