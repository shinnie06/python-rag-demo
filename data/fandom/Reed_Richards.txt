Doctor Reed Richards is the husband of Sue Storm, a world-famous, extraordinarily intelligent scientist, and the founding leader of the Fantastic Four named Mister Fantastic, who can stretch his body to various proportions. Four years after his team's formation, Richards and Storm were expecting a son named Franklin Richards, and eventually, they were warned by Silver Surfer of Galactus' intent to devour Earth. The Fantastic Four attempted to reason with Galactus, but refused when he demanded for Mister Fantastic's son in exchange for the planet's safety, causing personal conflicts and complications for him. He soon attempted to use Teleportation Bridges around the world to teleport Earth far away from Galactus, though this plan was foiled when Silver Surfer sabotaged nearly all the Bridges. Instead, when Galactus arrived in New York City to claim Franklin, Mister Fantastic and his team successfully used a Bridge to banish Galactus far into space, saving his family and the world.

## Biography

 

### Early Life

#### Teaching Science

Richards earned PhDs in astrophysics, engineering, and mathematics. He became a teacher and mentor, priding himself in that work as he saw many of his students go on to become successful scientists in their own right. 

#### Construction of the Baxter Building

 
Richards was involved in the construction of the Baxter Building in New York City, having planned where it would be and designed it. Richards was unaware, however, that there was a society underneath it that would be disrupted by the construction. 

### Founding the Fantastic Four

#### Gaining Abilities

 , Sue, and Johnny prepare for launch]]
 
Richards built a spacecraft far more advanced than anything which existed at the time, working alongside engineers and technicians with a hands-on approach. The construction process led to the invention of a lightweight, heat-resistant alloy for the ship. Richards, along with Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm, took it into space, hoping to gather data on Cosmic Radiation. 
 ]]
However, while they were in space, an unanticipated storm of cosmic radiation bombarded the ship and got through it's defenses. The radiation gave each of them a unique superpower, with Richards' body becoming elastic. The four returned to Earth, and Richards insisted that they isolate themselves so that they can better understand their changed physiognomies and ensure they were not a danger to those around them. They went to Rocket City and stayed in Building Q. 

#### Isolation

 
Having spent a long time in isolation, Johnny Storm asked when they would be allowed to leave. Sue Storm, referring to Richards as "Dr. Richards," made a comment about Richards not telling them how long it would be, and Richards told Sue not to be so formal with him while saying that he would indicate when it was time to leave quarantine. Meanwhile, Ben Grimm broke K.E.R.B.I.E., leading to a fight between him and Johnny. Richards attempted to intervene, getting involved in the fight as he wrapped his body around Johnny and Grimm, asking Sue for help. Sue was distracted, but then noticed what happened and put all three men in force fields, depriving of them of oxygen momentarily and forcing them to stop.
 ]]
Once they recovered, Sue told them all that there was a situation in New York City, directing their attention to the computer. They saw news footage of Moloids attacking the surface world, shocking them all. Grimm told Richards that it would have to be time to leave. Richards felt conflicted about leaving, understanding as a scientist that they were all stable while still feeling concern for the people he had come to consider a family. The team got into the Fantasticar and left Building Q, heading toward New York. 

#### Revolt of Subterranea

 defeats Giganto]]
 
The four landed in New York City and were immediately surrounded by paparazzi, which made Richards uncomfortable. However, he put his personal discomfort aside so they could defend the city. They all looked into a large hole in the ground, when suddenly Giganto appeared out of it and began attacking. Ben Grimm charged the monster, but Richards shouted at him for stop since they did not have a plan. However, Grimm simply said they needed to clobber Giganto. Johnny Storm was worried about causing panic with their powers, but Richards said that they were all feeling that way and encouraged Storm to help. Richards wrapped himself around Giganto as they all fought, and Sue Storm eventually used a forcefield to suffocate Giganto.
 confront Harvey Elder]]
Richards regrouped with the rest of the team, when suddenly the Pan Am Building fell underground, having been stolen by their attackers, making Richards afraid. However, the team reached where the building stood and went underground anyway. As they reached the ground floor of the Pan Am Building, Harvey Elder ordered the Moloids to attack. Richards began wrapping himself around Elder and complimented the technology needed to steal the Pan Am Building, but Elder cut Richards off and called him an oppressor. Richards shouted a warning to Sue Storm as a pregnant Moloid attacked her with a pick.

Storm trapped the Moloid in a force field, and Elder pleaded with Richards to let the pregnant woman go in exchange for Elder's surrender, so Richards demanded that Elder prove his sincerity. Elder called off the attack and declared himself a political prisoner as Richards bound Elder's arms together with his body. Elder was moved into one of Storm's forcefields as the team walked away, and Grimm noted that the Moloid that attacked Storm was pregnant. Richards said that it was absurd to fight in such a condition, leading Grimm to note that Richards had a rigid way of thinking. 

#### Establishing Peace

Sue Storm talked to Harvey Elder while Elder was in custody and agreed to help Elder reestablish his society underground in a way that kept both Elder's people and humans happy. While Storm worked to establish sovereignty for Subterranea with the United Nations, Richards spoke with the United States Congress in working to establish peace, saying that he did not know the construction of the Baxter Building would affect Subterranea since he did not know Subterranea existed. He likened the situation to stepping in a hornet's nest when in a place people did not know hornet's nests could be. He also talked to the New York City Council, explaining that Giganto's attack was only a small portion of the fight and that he felt real fear when realizing the full scale of the Revolt of Subterranea. Despite this, he continued to work to build the peaceful nature between the two peoples and helped to rebuild Subterranea. The Fantastic Four moved into the Baxter Building full time and hosted the Moloids, which Richards enjoyed. The team held a ribbon cutting ceremony and celebrated their new building. 

### Fame

#### Interviews

Richards was interviewed about his period of isolation and the Revolt of Subterranea many times, including by Science Dad for their magazine. Richards told Science Dad about how their period of isolation allowed them to understand their changes and ensure they were not dangerous. In an interview for Timely, Richards talked about his conflicted feelings regarding leaving Building Q for the first time, referring to the Fantastic Four as his "cohort." Sue Storm later said in a telecast that Richards intended to say "family." While talking to The Introspective Introvert Hour, Richards expressed concern with Harvey Elder, who he mistakenly called "Mole Man," declaring war on the surface world and said that scientists could not be involved in war. While on The Ted Gilbert Report, Richards said that the team's own personal discomfort during the revolt did not matter due to the need to protect the city. 

#### Advancing Scientific Study

Richards continued his work in science, expanding his expertise to include chemistry and biology. He became and advisor to the American National Space Agency, helping the United States' space program grow. He developed theoretical models on propulsion systems with the hopes of being able to land on the moon. He also became notable as a biologist, making discoveries about DNA and gene manipulation that promised to eradicate genetic diseases and improve crop yields. He also worked to advocate for more ethical scientific practices, encouraging scientists to focus on the societal implications of their work. He also advocated for international cooperation on space exploration, hoping to establish permanent space stations and colonies on the moon.

At one point, Richards delivered a lecture titled Unstable Molecules: Modern Superscience and Modern Superscientist at the 314 St. YMCA, talking about Unstable Molecules. Talking about the Revolt of Subterranea, he explained how much bigger the world suddenly got, saying that while most scientists would dream of that, it had become Richards' nightmare.
