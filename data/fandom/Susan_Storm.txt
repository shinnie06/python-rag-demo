Doctor Susan "Sue" Storm is the wife of Reed Richards, the older sister of Johnny Storm, the leader of the Future Foundation and a founding member of the Fantastic Four known as Invisible Woman, having the ability to become invisible and generate powerful fields of invisible force.

One day, Storm discovered that she was expecting a child. Soon after announcing her pregnancy, Silver Surfer arrived and declared that Galactus would consume the Earth. Searching for a way to prevent this, the Fantastic Four traced her energy to another planet across the universe, only to witness it be destroyed by Galactus. They were subsequently caught by Silver Surfer and brought before Galactus, who informed Storm that her child possessed the Power Cosmic and that he sought to make him his successor. Refusing to give up her child, the team managed to escape, although Galactus forced Storm into premature labor, and she gave birth to a son, whom she named Franklin Richards. 

Upon returning to Earth, her decision to keep her child caused the general public to turn against the Fantastic Four. However, Storm managed to quell their anger and unrest by introducing them to her child publicly and assuring them that they would make it through this as a family. When their plan to move the Earth was thwarted by Silver Surfer, Storm ultimately agreed to use Franklin as bait to lure Galactus into their Teleportation Bridge. Unfortunately, Galactus saw through their trap, and captured him. Seeing this, Storm pushed her powers to their limits and forced Galactus into the bridge, sacrificing herself so Reed could save their child. However, Franklin used his powers for the first time to resurrect her. 

Four years later, Storm encountered Doctor Doom interacting with her son in the Baxter Building and prepared to confront him.

Also tired, Sue Storm told her brother to ask Reed Richards, who she referred to as "Dr. Richards," commenting that he was the one holding them. Richards said that they would be able to leave when he decided they were ready, telling Sue not to be so formal with him. Looking at the computer, Sue saw news reports of an attack in New York City and got distracted. She turned around to find Storm, Richards, and Ben Grimm fighting, so she surrounded each of their heads with forcefields, depriving them of oxygen until they stopped. Sue then directed the team's attention toward the news report. Richards struggled to decide whether to leave, so Sue brought him tea and checked on him as Richards was worried about his friends.

#### Establishing Peace

 ]]
 
Storm visited Harvey Elder in his holding cell, where Elder said that he learned from Storm's grandfather. Storm did not believe that he was her grandfather's student studying particle physics, so Elder clarified that he worked at the campus' physical plant and that he grandfather taught him how to organize and that he made Elder into a leader. Storm commented on Elder having built a city, but Elder corrected her and said that it was a society. Storm recognized that Elder cared for his people and asked how they could work together to help the people they each cared about. Elder told Storm that his people wanted recognition and prosperity.

Storm corrected Richards and said that he meant to say "family." In an interview with Millicent Collins for Make Mine Millie!, Storm said that New York City felt like a separate planet upon the Fantastic Four's arrival after their quarantine, saying that that was the moment it had all changed for them. In The Visible Woman: Sue Storm and Subterranea, Storm talked about how frustrated she was after the revolt that it appeared their powers were being used to attack people from new cultures, and she said that she could not accept that. 

#### Teaching Science

## Powers and Abilities

### Powers

 
*Cosmic Energy Enhanced Physiology: While on a mission to space, Sue Storm was subjected to Cosmic Radiation, which altered her DNA and gave the cells in her body the ability to produce energies with unique properties allowing her to display the following abilities.
**Electromagnetic Spectrum Manipulation: The cells in Sue's body allow her to bend visible light, infrared, ultraviolet, and other forms of light from the spectrum around and away from her body. This produces a number of different effects based on her intention.
***Invisibility: Sue can render herself and other objects invisible by bending the light spectrum around and away from her and her targets. She's able to selectively turn parts of her body invisible. While pregnant, she to turned her stomach invisible in order to show Reed their baby in order to dissuade his concerns about the baby's biology. 
****Invisibility Extension: Storm can extend her invisibility to hide objects and other subjects. Storm was able to turn the Fantasticar invisible while fighting Galactus, as well as turn the Excelsior invisible while in labor. This ability does not affect every other sense and is vulnerable to advanced technology. Her ability to extend her invisibility thus far requires physical contact with the object Sue wishes to affect. It is unknown if she can render other objects invisible remotely.
***Hyperspatial Force-Field Generation: The cells in Sue's brain emit an energy that allows her to generate a potent force composed of pressurized space. She can project and shape this force for numerous purposes, such as to block incoming attacks, contain a target, or to move and manipulate objects. Sue's force-fields manifest as a undulating energy that bends the light around it, giving the force a prismatic element. This can be used to refract light and function as a magnifying glass, doing so to enhance her brother's fire attack when fighting against Galactus, temporarily blinding him.
****Force-Field Telekinesis: Storm is able to move and manipulate objects by creating force fields around said objects. She was able to constrict and throw the Silver Surfer during the team's escape from Galactus. When amplified by her emotions, Storm's telekinesis was strong enough to throw the Galactus into the last remaining Teleportation Bridge and cause physical damage to his armor.
****Force-Field Blast: Storm can release force-field blasts from her hands by focusing on a target. Storm blasted her brother Johnny while in labor on the Excelsior and again in the Baxter Building to get his attention. She can also use these blasts in more potent fashions as when she angrily blasted a television set.
