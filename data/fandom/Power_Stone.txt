The Power Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a singularity that predated the universe, representing the element of power. It was used by the Celestial Eson the Searcher until it was contained within the Orb and hidden for millennia on a Morag temple.

The Orb containing the Power Stone was coveted by Thanos, who employed the Kree warrior Ronan the Accuser in 2014 to retrieve it for him. However, before Ronan could acquire the Orb, it was stolen by Star-Lord, prompting a galaxy-wide hunt that resulted in the Orb being given to the Nova Corps for safe-keeping. Thanos later retrieved the Power Stone from the Nova Corps in 2018 and inserted it into his Infinity Gauntlet, using it in conjunction with the other five stones to eliminate half of all life in the universe. Following the completion of his life's goal, Thanos destroyed all six stones to prevent his work from being undone.

In 2023, the Avengers initiated a Time Heist in order to resurrect the victims of the Snap, with War Machine and Nebula sent back in time to retrieve the Power Stone from Morag from an alternate 2014 timeline. Following the Battle of Earth, where Iron Man used all six stones to kill Thanos and his army at the cost of his own life, Captain America time-traveled to the alternate 2014 to return the Power Stone.

## History

### Origin

 
 ]]
The Power Stone is a remnant of one of the six singularities which existed before the universe. After the universe came to be, the Big Bang forged the remnants of these singularities into six elemental crystals, dubbed the Infinity Stones, and hurtled them across the universe. The Power Stone represented the destructive nature of the universe, and was incredibly powerful, capable of annihilating entire planets. The Power Stone was used by the Celestial Eson the Searcher to destroy planets and civilizations until it was forgotten inside the Orb for millennia.
 
It was later in possession of a group of eight beings who attempted to harness the Stone's power by sharing it between them, linking themselves together. The effects were short-lived as the energy of the stone disintegrated the group after only a few moments. Eventually, the Orb, and the stone inside it, were hidden on the planet Morag, where it was stored it in a secret tomb beneath a vast ocean that would recede only once every 300 years. 

### Quest for the Orb

#### Collector's Demonstration

 finally opens up the Orb]]
 
In August 2014, the Orb had been found by Star-Lord, he found himself on a mission with the Guardians of the Galaxy to sell it before Ronan the Accuser could find it and use its power for evil. The Guardians took the Orb to the Collector where he used his technology to open the Orb while explaining the history of the Infinity Stones, marveling at the Power Stone when it was finally revealed to him as he prepared to pay for it.
 is destroyed by the Power Stone]]
However, the Collector's assistant Carina saw an opportunity to gain the power to kill her master and attempted to grab the stone to use it, only for its power to violently rip through her body, destroying her entirely as well as much of the Collector's Museum. The Guardians attempted to escape with the Orb, only to be found by Ronan and his soldiers, as Nebula was able to defeat Gamora and took the stone into her own possession to return it to Ronan, much to the Guardians' horror. 

#### Ronan's Betrayal

 takes possession of the Power Stone]]
 
Upon learning that the Orb contained the Power Stone after acquiring it from the Guardians of the Galaxy, Ronan the Accuser questioned his need for Thanos' assistance in his quest for revenge. Ronan ripped the Orb in half and took the Stone from it, consuming its energy and causing explosions all around him before attaching the Stone to his Universal Weapon in order to control its power. He became so powerful that he was no longer afraid of even the Mad Titan himself, who watched in silence and anger at the betrayal and cut off contact soon without being fazed by Ronan's threats to kill him. 

#### Battle of Xandar

 attacking the Nova Corps' armies]]
 
Unfazed by his enemies' attack on Xandar and filled with more power than all of them combined, Ronan the Accuser responded standing before the fleet of Nova Corps' Star Blasters and accusing them before sentencing them to destruction. He then used the Stone's power to fire a powerful blast from the Universal Weapon which destroyed the Nova Corps' entire fleet, as the burning remains of the army flew to the ground below and Ronan looked at the destruction with a sense of satisfaction watching all of the pain he was causing.
 attacks the Guardians of the Galaxy]]
While he continued to watch the battle unfold, Ronan found himself confronted by the Guardians of the Galaxy after they subdued his bodyguards and shot Ronan in the chest with the Hadron Enforcer. Ronan then easily overpowered the group with a single shockwave blast from the Power Stone using his hammer. Smiling to himself at the desperate and pathetic attempts to stop him that were proved worthless, Ronan the Accuser mocked the Guardians of the Galaxy and prepared to unleash the Stone's power to annihilate Xandar.
 and Star-Lord reach for the Stone]]
The moment before he could unleash the power, he became distracted by Star-Lord, who had challenged him to a dance-off. This distraction allowed Rocket enough time to repair the Hadron Enforcer allowing Drax the Destroyer to fire it at him, managing to destroy Ronan's Universal Weapon, disarming him and leaving the incredibly powerful Power Stone flying in the air before him. In a desperate move to gain the advantage in the battle and kill each other, both Ronan and Peter Quill attempted to catch the Stone during the split second it hung unprotected in the air before them. Despite Ronan's best efforts to regain the powerful weapon, Quill was a moment faster and quickly caught the Stone. 

#### Ronan's Destruction

 use the Power Stone]]
 
The moment the Power Stone was touched by Peter Quill's hand, it unleashed a massive amount of energy, causing a shock-wave which threw Ronan backwards as flames engulfed the group. As Ronan watched on with a sense of delight, the Stone's incredible and almost uncontrollable power nearly killed Quill as his body was slowly ripped apart from the inside by the Stone. Ronan laughed as he watched Quill screaming in horrific pain.
 being destroyed by the Power Stone]]
However, Ronan witnessed Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, and Rocket come together as a team and grab each other's hands, helping with the burden of the Stone's power and gaining complete control over it. He looked on in horror and demanded to know how that was possible for a human to survive such power and Quill informed him it was because together they were a team, before directing the Stone's energy at Ronan, destroying his body and killing him. Shortly after his destruction, Gamora quickly contained the stone inside the orb, ending its strain on the four of them and putting an end to the shock-wave. 

#### Stored Away

Following the Battle of Xandar, the Power Stone was stored in the Nova Corps Headquarters vault and remained untouched for four years. 

### Infinity War

#### Acquired by Thanos

 ' Infinity Gauntlet]]
 
In May 2018, Thanos in his quest for the Infinity Stones, went to Xandar to retrieve the Power Stone. After decimating Xandar and the Nova Corps, he acquired the Power Stone and inserted it in the Infinity Gauntlet.
 tortures Thor with the Power Stone]]
He then used the Stone to torture Thor and to obliterate the Statesman. He also used the Stone in unison with the Space Stone to torture Nebula.
 obliterates a massive piece of debris]]
On Titan, Thanos used the Power Stone's energy manipulating powers when he battled Tony Stark, Peter Parker, Doctor Strange, and members of the Guardians of the Galaxy. He used the Stone to destroy a large piece of debris sent by Stark, blast energy repeatedly at Peter Quill, and later a shockwave, knocking out Drax, Quill, and Nebula.
 telekinetically ripping apart a moon]]
His most notable feat was using the Power Stone to crush Titan's moon so he could hurl the pieces at his enemies, using the Space Stone to transport them to Titan's surface. He then used the Power Stone to send out a beam of energy at Strange when he dueled with him after dodging all of the fiery rays of energy with a simple powerful leap and later to destroy Strange's use of the Mirror Dimension by empowering the Gauntlet with the Power Stone's energy.
 fires a blast of energy at Iron Man]]
Thanos also used the Power Stone to send a beam of energy that almost overwhelmed Stark's shield and then to send him flying with a concentrated beam that heavily damaged the armor. His final use of the Power Stone in the battle was to emit its energy from the Gauntlet to act as a barrier to deflect Stark's repulsors while simultaneously walking towards Stark, allowing him to quickly end the attack by punching off the armor's helmet.
 blocks Okoye's Vibranium Spear]]
Upon arriving in Wakanda, Thanos used the Power Stone to knock away Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes and then to stop Okoye's spear in mid-air and knock her away. After completing the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos used all the Stones in conjunction to enact the Snap, successfully wiping out half of the universe. 

### Destruction

Three weeks after the Snap, Thanos destroyed all the Infinity Stones, including the Power Stone by using the stones' powers on itself, in order to eliminate any possibility of undoing the Snap. 

### Alternate Universe Versions

#### Theft of the Power Stone

 steals the Power Stone from 2014]]
 
In 2023, the Avengers initiated a Time Heist via the Quantum Realm where they used time travel through the Multiverse into alternate past timelines and acquire all six Infinity Stones in order to resurrect the victims of Thanos' Snap. Arriving in an alternate 2014, War Machine and Nebula were sent to Morag to retrieve the Power Stone from the Temple Vault, where War Machine knocked an alternate Star-Lord unconscious. After Nebula successfully retrieved the Orb, War Machine used the Quantum Realm to return to his timeline, bringing the Orb with him.
 ]]
After successfully transporting the alternate versions of the Stones to their timeline, the Power Stone was extracted from the Orb and placed in the Nano Gauntlet. Using the Gauntlet, Bruce Banner harnessed the power of the six Stones to resurrect the victims of the Snap, albeit losing the ability to use his right arm.
 wielding the Power Stone]]
However, moments after the Blip, the Avengers Compound was destroyed by missile strikes fired by an alternate Thanos, who had time-traveled from the alternate 2014 timeline to the main timeline. Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor fought Thanos before they were given assistance by the newly resurrected heroes. Obtaining the Nano Gauntlet, Thanos was attacked by Captain Marvel, forcing him to use the Power Stone separately from the Nano Gauntlet to blast her away, rendering her unconscious. He then quickly reattached the Power Stone to continue his attack.
 ]]
However, the stones were then stolen from him by Iron Man, who sacrificed his life by using all six stones to kill Thanos and his army. Following Stark's funeral, Rogers was sent back in time by Banner in order to put back the Infinity Stones to whence they were taken, and journeyed to the alternate 2014 to return the Power Stone, albeit without the Orb. 

#### Seized by the TVA

 ]]
While capturing Variants and pruning timelines, the Time Variance Authority seized Infinity Stones from alternate timelines, including numerous Power Stones. 
 

#### Found by T'Challa

 arrives to steal the stone]]
 
In an alternate 2008, T'Challa found the Orb containing the Power Stone on Morag and brought it back to show the Ravagers. 
 

#### Zombie Outbreak Universe

 with the Power Stone]]
In an alternate 2018, Thanos was able to obtain the Power Stone before setting off to Earth. However, once he got to Earth, he became infected by zombies. 

During the battle that followed, Thanos' infected mind had trouble wielding the power of the Stones at first, but he quickly adapted. When Thor, Rocket and Groot arrived, Thor threw Stormbreaker into Thanos' chest. Unable to feel pain anymore, Thanos unleashed the Power Stone on the trio, mutilating Thor's face and killing the latter two. Thanos then used the Power Stone to shatter the ground around Birnin Zana before lifting the debris with the Space Stone, exposing its reactor core. When Spider-Man pulled Stormbreaker from Thanos' chest to hurl it back at him, Thanos disintegrated the weapon with a blast from the Power Stone. After Thanos had claimed the Mind Stone and completed the Gauntlet, Black Panther, in an act of ultimate sacrifice, tackled Thanos into Birnin Zana's exposed vibranium reactor core, killing the Mad Titan. 

However, the Infinity Stones were shattered in the process, releasing a hurricane of Infinity Energy that nearly killed Peter Parker and Scott Lang before they were saved by the Masters of the Mystic Arts. The Infinity Energy continued its destructive spread across the planet before finally being contained by Infinity Hulk in Paris. 

#### Age of Ultron Universe

 ' Infinity Gauntlet]]
In an alternate 2015, Thanos collected the Power Stone and inserted it on the Infinity Gauntlet. The Power Stone was then seized by Ultron and was used to destroy Asgard and other planets in the universe. Ultron then used the Power Stone in combat against Watcher in the Observational Plane. The Stone was also used in conjunction with the other Stones to obliterate other universes. The Power Stone was caught in a tug-of-war by Erik Killmonger and Arnim Zola resulting in Strange Supreme trapping Killmonger, Zola, and the Stones inside a pocket dimension. 
 

#### Infinity War

 with the stones]]
In an alternate universe where the Illuminati was formed, Thanos made it to Titan with four Infinity Stones. However, the Power Stone was not strong enough to defeat Doctor Strange and the Darkhold. 

## Capabilities

 
As the Infinity Stone that embodies both the sustaining and destructive forces of the universe, the Power Stone grants its wielder tremendous energy manipulation capabilities. Due to the amount of energy the Power Stone releases, it is the most destructive out of all the Infinity Stones in terms of raw power. Like all Infinity Stones, the Power Stone is among the most powerful artifacts in the universe, with only beings of an extraordinary constitution being able to directly wield it without being destroyed. Outside a container able to hold its power, the Power Stone's energy is highly volatile, violently and explosively reacting to any organic matter. The release of power is directly proportional to the size of the organic target, with even direct physical contact with a planet's surface being enough to trigger a reaction powerful enough to destroy the planet and every living being on it.

When using the Stone via direct physical contact, less powerful beings are quickly disintegrated in a violent explosion. The more powerful the being is, the longer they are able to survive and even wield the Stone's power without being destroyed, as demonstrated by beings such as Thanos. Additionally, multiple beings are able to link together and distribute the Stone's power between each other, making it easier to withstand the Stone's effects, as demonstrated by the Guardians of the Galaxy. Even still, attempting to use the Stone without any safety measures is extremely painful and dangerous, even for groups or incredibly powerful beings. The Power Stone Group, as shown in the Collector hologram, were disintegrated when attempting to harness the Stone's energy despite sharing its power amongst themselves, and Star-Lord was nearly killed from holding the Stone with his hand despite his half-Celestial biology.

The Power Stone can be safely used via a conduit, such as the Universal Weapon or Infinity Gauntlet, preventing the need to touch the Stone while still being able to utilize its power. Successful wielders of the Power Stone, both directly and indirectly via a conduit, are able to project its destructive power to both enhance attacks and violently destroy targets, even entire planets. This can manifest through fiery purple energy beams, waves, or even melee attacks, as demonstrated by Thanos using the Stone directly to knock out Captain Marvel with an enhanced punch.

In certain cases, the Stone's energy also passively enhances the user's strength and durability. While wielding the Power Stone in the Universal Weapon, Ronan the Accuser was able to withstand a close-range shot from the Hadron Enforcer, a weapon claimed to be powerful enough to destroy a moon, and walk away unscathed from the wreckage of the Dark Aster after it crashed into the surface of Xandar.

When used in the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos, having a more comprehensive understanding of its abilities, was able to use its destructive capabilities to great effect in combat. Thanos is able to project waves of energy for both offensive and defensive purposes, throwing opponents away, rendering them unconscious, and deflecting enemy attacks, such as Iron Man's repulsors. The Stone's power can be fired in concentrated beams and blasts, strong enough to heavily damage Iron Man's nanotech armor with prolonged contact.

Thanos also displayed the ability to manipulate the Stone's destructive power with precise control, such as torturing Thor by pressing the Stone to the Asgardian's head, burning him without killing him, and charging objects with the Stone's energy, causing them to overload and violently detonate. Thanos was able to slowly overload and detonate the Statesman after retrieving the Space Stone, giving himself enough of a delay to teleport himself and his Children away. In its greatest displays of power within the Gauntlet, Thanos was able to use its power to shatter a gateway to the Mirror Dimension sent by Doctor Strange, as well as remotely shatter the surface of Titan's moon without requiring physical contact with its surface.

Thanos is able to combine the Power Stone with the other Infinity Stones to enhance its powers and achieve a wider variety of effects. Combining the Space Stone and Power Stone, Thanos is able to manipulate and redirect outside energy, absorbing and channeling the explosive power of Iron Man's missiles into a concentrated beam of fire, as well as torture Nebula by telekinetically disassembling her body and inflicting unbearable pain upon her. When confronted by a swarm of illusory clones of Doctor Strange, Thanos is able to use both the Power Stone and the Soul Stone in conjunction to both destroy the illusions and discover the real Doctor Strange, forcefully ejecting his astral form from his body. 

When alongside all other Infinity Stones in a completed Gauntlet, the Stone is able to perform immensely powerful feats. In its most basic use, the Gauntlet can unleash a beam of white energy combining the power of all six Infinity Stones, which can be counteracted by a sufficiently powerful weapon like Stormbreaker. In their most powerful uses, the Stones are able to instantly kill/destroy and revive/recreate both lifeforms and inanimate objects with a simple snap of one's fingers, reducing affected beings/objects into dust or reconstituting them from thin air. This effect can be applied at a scale of the user's choosing, from only targeting a specific group to affecting life on a universal scale, able to randomly kill (and later revive) half of all life in the Universe. The sole exception to this are lifeforms sacrificed to the Soul Stone, who cannot be revived even with the power of all six Stones.

Together, the Stones are even able to destroy themselves by turning their energies upon each other, reducing them to nothing but atoms. These individual acts are enough to produce an energy surge of cosmic proportions, enough to be detected entire systems away. After changing his goals, the 2014 Thanos would further claim that the Stones are capable of both completely destroying and recreating the entire Universe in his utopic image, with an abundance of life that only knows the blessings he has given it, and nothing of the previous Universe destroyed to create it.

However, using all six Stones for such acts draws a great physical toll on the user's body and the weapon used to control them, severely burning both with the Stones' energy. It is enough to damage the Uru-made Infinity Gauntlet, kill an ordinary human like Iron Man, and scorch the arms and bodies of more powerful users like Hulk or Thanos into uselessness. Wounds sustained in this manner are near-permanent, and cannot be healed with the Stones' power.

## Trivia

*In the comics, the red Power Gem gives the owner access to all power and energy that ever has or will exist, and can back the other gems, boosting their effects. Its most basic powers grant its user unlimited stamina and can increase the user's strength to unlimited levels depending on how much the gem is drawn upon. It allows the user to duplicate practically any physical superhuman ability and become invincible. It was used by the Champion of the Universe, Thanos, Nebula, Adam Warlock, Drax the Destroyer, Thor, Magus, Rune, Lord Pumpkin, Loki, Galactus, She-Hulk, Titania, Mister Fantastic, Odeni, Hood, Red Hulk, Xiambor, and Namor.
*Eson the Searcher, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ronan the Accuser, Hulk, Thanos and Iron Man are the only beings to have successfully used the Power Stone thus far, with the latter three using it in conjunction with all of the other Stones.
*Thanos used the Power Stone on its own far more than he did with the other Stones, likely due to its raw power and flexibility of use, as well as the fact he'd had it in his possession the longest. It was also the Stone most used in conjunction with other Stones, such as when he used it to destroy Titan's moon while using the Space Stone to pull the debris towards Iron Man or when he used it in conjunction with the Soul Stone to destroy Doctor Strange's astral copies during their fight.
*The Power Stone is one of the only two Infinity Stones that were never on Earth prior to Thanos inserting it into the Infinity Gauntlet, the other being the Soul Stone.

## Behind the Scenes

*During the production of Guardians of the Galaxy, the Power Stone was meant to be red just like its comic book counterpart. However, this was later changed to purple in post-production when it was decided that the red Aether from Thor: The Dark World was in fact the Reality Stone. Stephane Ceretti on X - April 8, 2020 James Gunn on Twitter - April 8, 2020
