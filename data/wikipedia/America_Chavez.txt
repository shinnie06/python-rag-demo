# America Chavez

America Chavez is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Joe Casey and artist Nick Dragotta, the character first appeared in Vengeance #1 (September 2011). Chavez is a lesbian superhero of Latin-American origin. She has assumed the mantle of Miss America, previously held by the superheroine Madeline Joyce. Over the course of her publication history, she has been a member of several superhero teams, including A-Force, the Ultimates, and the Young Avengers. 
The character was initially depicted as originating from the Utopian Parallel, a dimension outside time and space. She was a Starling of the Fuertona species, an alien race typically possessing supernatural abilities. Her origin was later retconned, revealing that she was born on Earth to scientists attempting to cure her of a disease. The Utopian Parallel was redefined as a medical facility where she underwent experimentation, which ultimately led to the development of her powers. Chavez's signature power is the creation of star-shaped portals that enable her to travel across space and time. 
Chavez has been described as one of Marvel's most notable and powerful female heroes, being labelled as the publisher's first Latin-American LGBT character to star in a comic book series as the eponymous character. Since her original introduction in comics, the character has been featured in various other Marvel-licensed products, including video games, animated television series, and merchandise. The character made her live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022), portrayed by Xochitl Gomez.

## Concept and creation

Joe Casey, the creator of America Chavez, expressed his desire to create a character that would resonate with audiences as deeply as certain figures had with him in his youth. Reflecting on 2010, he admitted uncertainty about whether a substantial audience existed for a Latina superhero, though he is gratified that the times have evolved to embrace her. He further remarked that he imbued Chavez with a distinctive individuality and robust self-confidence, envisioning her as a figure of formidable strength and resolve. In his view, she was crafted as "the Muhammad Ali of the Marvel Universe," embodying heroism that transcends traditional roles, much like Ali's impact extended beyond boxing.

## Fictional character biography

America Chavez believed she was raised by her mothers in the Utopian Parallel, a reality that is out of time and in the presence of the being known as the Demiurge, whose presence she credited with imbuing her with superpowers. In her memory, when Chavez was approximately six years old, the Utopian Parallel was threatened by destruction with black holes. Chavez's mothers sacrificed themselves to seal the black holes, resulting in their particles being scattered across the Multiverse itself. Wanting to prove herself as a hero and knowing Utopia did not require salvation, Chavez ran away from her home and her responsibilities. She traveled across different realities, eventually adopted the moniker of Miss America, and began covertly acting as a superhero.
Chavez eventually joined the Teen Brigade and served as co-leader with Ultimate Nullifier. With the Teen Brigade, she freed the In-Betweener from the government confinement center, "Groom Lake Adjacent" in Nevada. With information from the In-Betweener, The Teen Brigade set out to prevent the Young Masters Evil from disrupting a delicate balance between chaos and order. To stop the Young Masters from recruiting Kid Loki, Chavez broke into the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but Loki used the Screaming Idol to send her to the Sixth Dimension. There she fought Tiboro, and was later rescued by the Last Defenders, She-Hulk, and Daimon Hellstrom, under the direction of the In-Betweener. She rejoined her teammates in Latveria where they fought the Braak'nhüd, Young Masters and Doctor Doom. The battle was ended when Ultimate Nullifier shot the In-Betweener. While the smoke cleared, the Teen Brigade covertly departed. Chavez would later part ways with the Teen Brigade due to "musical differences".
After leaving the Teen Brigade, Chavez eventually traveled to Earth-212 and was later approached by the teenage trickster Loki. He pretends to try to persuade Chavez into killing Wiccan for the good of the Multiverse. Disgusted with the proposition, Chavez fights with Loki and decides to protect Wiccan. On Earth-616, Chavez stopped Loki from magically attacking Wiccan in his home. Hulkling intervened, but America and Loki quickly fled with little explanation. Chavez later rescued Hulkling, Wiccan, and Loki from the Mother, an inter-dimensional parasite awoken by one of Loki's spells. They all escape aboard Marvel Boy's ship, and aided them in the final face-off with Mother's forces in Central Park. Later, in Young Avengers #15, she reveals offhandedly to the team that she is not interested in men, and writes off her one-time kiss with the male teen superhero Ultimate Nullifier as experimentation. She later begins dating Lisa, an EMT, and dances with her to "close a hole in the universe." She also had a crush on Lady Katherine of Bishop, an alternate version of Kate Bishop, and they have a close relationship.
During the 2015 Secret Wars storyline, Chavez appears as a member of the A-Force, an all-female team of Avengers. Her fans formed a gang called La Chiquitas and changed their hair to Chavez symbols, including fan Sydney Walker. When the island nation of Arcadia is attacked by a megalodon, Chavez throws the shark across the Shield, the wall that separates Arcadia's borders, thus breaking the laws of King Doom. She is subsequently arrested and sentenced to spend the rest of her life protecting the Shield.
After the events of Secret Wars, Chavez joined the newly formed Ultimates team after being invited by Blue Marvel. Chavez also attends Sotomayor University as a student, where she also shares a class with former Young Avenger teammate Prodigy.
In the series America Chavez: Made in the USA, what Chavez knew about her background was called into question. Her previously unknown sister, Catalina, forced her to remember that her mothers were not aliens, but human doctors Amalia and Elena Chavez. The doctors took their daughters to a private island called the Utopian Parallel to attempt to cure the disease Edges Syndrome, but later discovered their benefactor had evil plans for all the girls brought there. Chavez gained her superpowers across experiments conducted on her as a child, when she was exposed to extra-dimensional energies. The doctors sacrificed themselves to free America, Catalina, and the other girls, but only America escaped. She was later adopted by the Santanas and took the name of America Santana. Catalina suggested that America made up the alien universe story as a coping mechanism.

## Powers and abilities

America Chavez acquired a range of superpowers after being exposed to extra-dimensional energies through experiments conducted on her. She possesses superhuman attributes, such as superhuman strength, speed, durability, and has the power of flight. Her invulnerability allows her to be bullet-proof and also makes her flame retardant. America Chavez also has the power to kick open star-shaped portals in reality, allowing her and her teammates to travel through the multiverse and into other realities, including the punch dimension. She is also able to use her star-shaped portals to travel through time. She can move beyond superhuman speed, being able to catch up to and nearly exceed the speed of light as observed by Spectrum in her light form. America Chavez has developed the ability to make an enemy burst into tiny star fragments with a punch. In moments of extreme duress, she has been shown to project a large star that releases a powerful energy blast, capable of injuring the likes of Captain Marvel. Her hyper-cosmic awareness allows her to have a metaphysical insight in space and time. She is able to increase her physical fighting ability by harnessing her inherent power from within. America Chavez does not age at a normal rate due to her increased lifespan. She is also a trained hand-to-hand combatant, owing to her powers and experience in street fighting.

## Cultural impact and legacy

### Critical response

Nivea Serrao of Entertainment Weekly referred to America Chavez as a "fan favorite" character following her appearance in Young Avengers, noting that the character subsequently headlined a "long-awaited" solo series. Dana Forsythe of Paste described Chavez as a "popular hero," noting that despite being a relatively new character introduced in 2011, she has quickly gained significant admiration within the Marvel Comics universe. Deirdre Kaye of Scary Mommy called Chavez a "role model" and a "truly heroic" female character. Kelly Knox of IGN characterized Chavez as a "no-nonsense heavy-hitter," portraying her as headstrong, tough, and fiercely independent, while also characterizing her as a "team player and natural leader." Alyssa Mora of IGN also named her one of their "favorite Latinx heroes." George Marston of Newsarama described Chavez as a "fan-favorite" member of both the Young Avengers and the West Coast Avengers teams. Nick Cimarusti of Sideshow named Chavez one of the "most influential Latinx figures in Marvel Comics" and called her one of the "familiar favorites."
Abraham Riesman of Vulture noted long-standing demand for a series centered on Chavez, describing her as a "one of a kind" queer Latina superhero who has developed a devoted following since her introduction in 2011 and her subsequent appearances with the Young Avengers. Riesman added that Marvel Comics only recently "wised up" by giving the character her own comic book series. Graeme Virtue of The Guardian praised Chavez as a "welcome departure from outdated superhero archetypes," noting that Marvel has now fully recognized her potential as a standout, standalone hero. Kyle Pinion of Comics Beat described America Chavez as "very popular," highlighting that she "garnered a huge fanbase" following her appearance in the Young Avengers series by Kieron Gillen, Jamie McKelvie, and Matt Wilson. 
Brian Gallagher of MovieWeb said that Chavez is one of Marvel's "newest and beloved characters," noting the significant fan excitement she has generated in recent years. Shaun Corley of Screen Rant called Chavez a "formidable hero," highlighting her status as a fan favorite since her debut. He noted her success across various team books, a solo title, and her transition to the MCU as impressive for a relatively new character. K.W. Colyard of Bustle referred to Chavez as a "cult-favorite character." Reid Carter of Popverse noted that Chavez is a favorite among cosplayers and fan artists, owing to her "fashionable assortment of patriotic jackets" and her status as one of the most powerful characters in the Marvel universe. Isabelia Herrera of The New York Times included Chavez in their list of "5 Latinx Superheroes to Inspire Your New York Comic Con Look" list, highlighting that the character, introduced in 2011, gained significant popularity with her first solo series written by queer Boricua novelist Gabby Rivera in 2017. 

Donohoo of Comic Book Resources said,America has been a part of predominantly critically well-received books, including the aforementioned Young Avengers and appearances in Kate Bishop's Hawkeye title. While she has had loud detractors, it bears repeating that she also rapidly amassed a relatively large and vocal fanbase. Her woes, in part, can be attributed to increased profile coinciding with a time when comics fans have increasingly dug in about "politics" in comics and a particular contingent reacting with venom to what they insist is "forced diversity". As a character, America's usually shown as a somewhat stony individual, being more observant than obnoxious and talkative. These qualities made her a strong figure within the Young Avengers, standing alongside the similarly star-spangled Patriot. Working alongside older heroes like Carol Danvers in the book The Ultimates, her admiration and respect for them was ironically seen as a legacy character done right. Her costume, much like Kamala Khan's, is also a great blend of stylish and superheroic, perfect for a modern multiversal Marvel heroine." 
Gemma Goodall of Daily Review included Chavez in her list of "10 More Female Superheroes who Deserve a Movie," expressing anticipation for a future film adaptation. Goodall noted that although Chavez's first solo comic book was released in March 2017 and it might take some time before the character appears on the big screen, she remains excited about the possibility.

Carlos Gomez of Daily Trojan said that Chavez is a "fascinating" character due to her relative newness, first appearing in 2011, and her growing popularity.

She commended the comic series for featuring a Latinx LGBTQ+ lead, which was rare in major comics, and appreciated how it "humanized" Chavez by exploring her personal struggles and distinctive perspective, adding depth to her character beyond her formidable exterior. Jason Wiese of CinemaBlend called a "teenage Latina and LGBTQ+ icon," asserting that she has quickly become a significant figure in Marvel Comics due to her cultural representation. He noted that despite her extra-dimensional origins, Chavez's introduction to Earth-616 through a Puerto Rican family deeply informed her ethnic identity. Wiese emphasized that her importance extends beyond just racial representation, highlighting her broader impact as a cultural icon. Nicole Chavez of CNN noted that Chavez is breaking new ground both "in the comics universe and beyond."

Matt Kim of Inverse described Chavez as a "fan favorite," highlighting her status as an "icon" among socially progressive comic readers.

Zack Krajnyak of Screen Rant found the potential inclusion of Chavez in the MCU to be "incredibly significant." He noted that her addition would represent a "significant milestone" due to her being a Latin-American LGBTQ character. Krajnyak expressed hope that Chavez would play a major role in the MCU's future, especially with the rumored inclusion of Young Avengers characters like Wiccan and Kate Bishop.

Michael Rizi of Queerty included America Chavez in their "6 LGBTQ Marvel Characters Who Deserve Their Own Shows Now" list.
Sam Damshenas of Gay Times included Chavez in their list of "13 Queer Superheroes We Need To See In The Marvel Cinematic Universe," asserting that her presence would be an exciting addition, especially given her fit for the sequel to Avengers: Infinity War.

### Impact

America Chavez has been the subject of comparisons with some characters in the comic book industry regarding her representation and abilities. In 2016, she was compared to the protagonist of a one-shot in development by writer Joe Casey (who created Chavez) and artist Dustin Nguyen for Image Comics, inspiring discussions among journalists about her influence on the new character. Several critics noted that Chavez served as an inspiration for the comic book publisher's latest protagonist, highlighting their similarities. This connection was further emphasized in subsequent years, particularly with the release of All-America Comix #1 (July 2020), where additional journalists asserted that Chavez inspired Casey and Nguyen for the creation of Image Comics' new character. Years later, in 2023, several critics noted similarities between the newly acquired superpowers of DC Comics' character Power Girl and those of Chavez.
The representation of the character has led to notable achievements and recognition. In 2017, Chavez was featured as the titular character in her own comic book series, America (2017–2018). She made history as the first Latin-American LGBT character in Marvel Comics to star in a solo comic book series as the eponymous character. In 2018, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote to America series writer Gabby Rivera, acknowledging the significance of the character. She stated, "You have created a powerful female character in the production of America, and I know you will forever inspire many individuals by continuing to invent America Chavez's story. Indeed, it is important to remind readers to take time to honor themselves and embrace their differences as strengths." Several journalists have also identified the character as the first Latin-American LGBT superhero to star in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise.
Chavez has generated significant public interest. She notably garnered media attention in March 2018 when American actress Gina Rodriguez expressed her enthusiasm to audition for the role of Chavez, declaring herself a fan of the character. This interest was echoed in May by Argentine-American actress Stephanie Beatriz, who also shared her desire to portray Chavez on Twitter. Chavez further captured the public's attention in October 2018 when Beatriz dressed up as Chavez for Halloween, generating significant media coverage. In September 2022, Chavez placed third in a popularity contest held by Multiversity Comics, where readers elected their "Favorite Latin American Superhero."
The character has been referenced in other media as well. In 2022, the comic book America Chavez: Made in the USA #1 (March 3, 2021) appeared as an easter egg in a display case in the final episode of the miniseries She-Hulk: Attorney at Law.

### Accolades

America Chavez won Favorite Queer Character at the 2014 Autostraddle Comic and Sequential Art Awards. In 2018, the America series was nominated for Outstanding Comic Book at the 29th GLAAD Media Awards. Chavez was also nominated for Best First Appearance at the 2022 Golden Issue Awards.

Matthew Aguilar of ComicBook.com gave America #1 a grade of 4 out of 5 stars, described America Chavez as a “breath of fresh air” and praised the character's confidence, charisma, and impulsiveness.

He also commended Joe Quinones' artwork as "lively" and "energetic." Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the first comic book 8.5 out of 10, stating that the issue effectively dispels any doubts about the need for a solo comic for America Chavez. He found the new series to offer an "engaging" portrayal of Chavez, focusing on humorous and grounded character drama rather than just superhero action.

Sam Stone of Comic Book Resources called America Chavez: Made in the USA #1 a "solid opening issue." He noted that the comic serves as an "accessible" entry point for readers unfamiliar with America Chavez, balancing action with introspection. Stone praised the script for effectively exploring the character's past and its impact on her future, with particular strength in the portrayal of her psyche. He found the present-day sequences more "effective" than the flashback elements. Stone also highlighted the successful collaboration between writer Vasquez and artist Gomez, which brings the themes of power and responsibility to a personal level, suggesting that the miniseries is set to deepen as it progresses. Robert Reed of Newsarama gave America Chavez: Made in the USA #1 a grade of 8 out of 10, writing that the series serves as a "modern homage to Superman's origin." Reed stated that the "draw to America Chavez: Made in the USA is the character herself," noting that the comic provides an "intimate look at America’s first night with her found family," an aspect of the character’s past that "hasn’t always been rendered with real detail." He also praised the portrayal of Chavez's vulnerability and the importance of her family relationships, writing that the creative team sets up what promises to be an emotionally charged limited series
