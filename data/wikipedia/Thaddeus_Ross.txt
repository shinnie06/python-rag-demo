# Thunderbolt Ross

General Thaddeus E. "Thunderbolt" Ross is a fictional character who appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics featuring the Hulk. Ross is a United States military officer, the father of Betty Ross, and the ex-father-in-law of both Glenn Talbot and Bruce Banner.
A jingoistic war hawk, Ross is portrayed as the military head of the gamma bomb project that turned Banner into the Hulk. After the creation of the Hulk, Ross pursues the creature with a growing obsession, and, after learning that Banner and the Hulk are one and the same, Ross hunts Banner as well. His motivations vary between different iterations, from a petulant hatred of Banner himself, to a Captain Ahab-esque desire to defeat the Hulk in combat, and sometimes even more villainous motivations such as hoping to harness the Hulk's abilities and create similar bioweapons for use by the US government. Ross was transformed into the first Red Hulk to better combat the Hulk, though this instead led him to become more sympathetic towards Banner and eventually become a superhero, serving as a member of the Avengers and forming his own Thunderbolts team.
Ross has appeared in numerous media adaptations, including animated television series, video games, and live-action feature films. He has been voiced by numerous actors in animation, including John Vernon, Keith Ferguson, Fred Tatasciore, and Clancy Brown. In live-action, Sam Elliott portrayed the character in the film Hulk (2003). In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the character is portrayed by William Hurt (2008–2021) and Harrison Ford (2025).

## Fictional character biography

Born to a prominent military family, with both his father and grandfather having served, Thaddeus Ross was primed to follow in their footsteps. He joined the Air Force straight out of high school and climbed the ranks quickly while raising a family.
Holding the rank of lieutenant general, Ross is chosen to oversee Bruce Banner's gamma bomb project. His daughter, Betty, takes a liking to the young scientist, deepening Ross' dislike for the "weakling". After Banner's transformation into the Hulk, Ross spends years chasing the monster, becoming obsessed enough to commit treason by allying himself with supervillains such as the Leader, MODOK and the Abomination to destroy the Hulk. Dismissed from the military, he shows up at Betty and Bruce's wedding with a gun and shoots Rick Jones. He is recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Clay Quartermain to merge with the electric creature Zzzax, a process that gives Ross superpowers but also makes him mentally unstable. He is later restored to human form, but retains some residual energy-generating powers.
Finally, the Nevermind, a mutant who drains people of their life energy, attacks Gamma Base in search of a strong host, in this case the Hulk. After witnessing Banner and Jones (who was the Hulk at that time) heroically engaging the mutant, Ross realizes that he has been wrong about the Hulk being a mindless monster. He saves his daughter by allowing the mutant to latch on him and discharging the energy resources he retained from Zzzax. Giving his blessing to Banner and Betty, he dies in his daughter's arms.
Ross' body is later stolen by the Leader, who uses the powers of one of his followers to resurrect him as a replacement for his fallen soldier Redeemer. Ross is eventually recovered and revived by agents of the alien Troyjan and returns to the Air Force. He later comes up with a more cost-effective method of confronting the Hulk: ignoring him.
Ross would become friends with Banner, but when Betty is seemingly killed due to what both Ross and Banner believed to have been Banner's gamma-irradiated DNA interacting with Betty's, he once more pursues the Hulk with a vendetta.
Around this time, General John Ryker takes over the pursuit of the Hulk. Ross is indirectly involved, observing when Ryker mentally tortures Banner to try to figure out how the Hulk works. The Hulk escapes from Ryker's control and, after several adventures, is lost in space.
After the Hulk returns from exile and initiates "World War Hulk", General Ross, now a full general, makes his own return, electing to bring the fight to his nemesis once more after the Hulk beats Iron Man. After a failed assault on the Hulk, Ross and his men are captured and placed in chains under the watch of the Warbound, the army he has brought back from space. The Hulk is eventually defeated via satellite weapons that revert him back to his human form.

### Red Hulk

The Red Hulk (also known as the Rulk or the IncREDible Hulk) was introduced in 2008 in Hulk (vol. 2) #1. The Red Hulk was created to be an uninhibited, tactically intelligent adversary to the Hulk. Although Kenneth Johnson, the creator of the 1970s TV series The Incredible Hulk, had suggested a red Hulk for that adaptation decades earlier, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada proposed the idea for the comics to debut a red version of the character whose human identity was a secret. Initially, the Red Hulk's identity was unknown both to the characters in the story and the reading audience.
The opening story arc of the Hulk (vol. 2) series that premiered in 2008 established that the Red Hulk is very aggressive, as he murders the Wendigo and Abomination; destroys the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier; defeats several Marvel heroes; and, after causing an earthquake in San Francisco, is defeated by the Hulk and Thor. In a subsequent storyline, the Collector places the character with other villains on a team called the Offenders, an evil version of the Defenders, in a bid to prevent the Hulk from reuniting with Jarella. In that story, the Red Hulk siphons the Power Cosmic from the Silver Surfer, seemingly killing him, steals his board and Terrax's cosmic axe, and kills Namor, Tiger Shark, Doctor Strange, Baron Mordo, the Grandmaster, Terrax, Hulk, and Psycho-Man. When the Red Hulk reveals this to Galactus, Galactus takes back the Power Cosmic from him. Subsequently, almost everyone he killed is resurrected with no memory of the event.
The Red Hulk was created as part of a super soldier program by several persons, including Doc Samson and the criminal think tank the Intelligencia, headed by MODOK. The 2009 "Code Red" story arc also made allusions to the Red Hulk's real identity, and introduced Red She-Hulk.
In the 2010 story line "Fall of the Hulks: Gamma", the Red Hulk is related in flashback to have killed General Ross at the behest of Bruce Banner, with whom he has formed an alliance. However, the 2010 "World War Hulks" story line reveals that the Red Hulk is Thunderbolt Ross, the Red She-Hulk is Betty Ross, and the Ross who was "killed" was a Life Model Decoy (LMD). The Red Hulk then thwarts the Intelligencia's plan to take over the United States with an LMD of Glenn Talbot by destroying the Talbot LMD and attempts to take over the country himself. He is thwarted by a restored Hulk, who beats the Red Hulk mostly due to the Red Hulk's exhaustion from overheating. The Hulk tells the Red Hulk that it was his idea to fake Ross' death and that he can never again resume that identity. After imprisoning the Red Hulk in Gamma Base, Banner makes arrangements with Steve Rogers for the Red Hulk to join the Avengers.
After Rogers recruits the Red Hulk, the Red Hulk stops the Intelligencia's failsafe plan "Scorched Earth". Although Banner had claimed that he removed the Red Hulk's energy-draining ability from him because it was killing him, he is shown to still possess this ability. After the events of the Scorched Earth program, the Red Hulk is paired up with an LMD named Annie. The Red Hulk is occasionally assaulted by Ross' former protégé General Reginald Fortean, a scientist given superhuman mutations by MODOK named Zero/One, and the Indian serial killer Black Fog.
The Red Hulk plays a vital role in the Infinity Gem crisis of the "Heroic Age" story line. During the 2011 "Fear Itself" story line, the Red Hulk attempts unsuccessfully to stop the Thing (in the form of Angrir, Breaker of Souls) from destroying Avengers Tower, as MODOK Superior and Black Fog converge on both combatants during the fight. Angrir dispatches the Red Hulk by knocking him out of the city and into Vermont.
As part of the 2012 Marvel NOW! relaunch, the Red Hulk leads a non-government sponsored version of the Thunderbolts. This incarnation is a strike team that cleans up the messes left by Ross' military career, but the team later decides on a new arrangement in which the team will do one mission for Ross, then a mission for a random member.
Ross is later depowered by Doc Green, a new personality of Bruce Banner who believes that gamma-powered superhumans are a threat to humanity. He is imprisoned, but is later paroled for helping a resistance cell during "Secret Empire". After being tortured by Cutthroat, who is acting on orders of Alexa Lukin and Crossbones, Ross suddenly regains his ability to transform into Red Hulk.
During the One World Under Doom event, Ross is kidnapped by Doctor Doom, who forces him to join his think tank. He is able to escape from the Doombots alongside Deathlok and Machine Man. After making their way to the Latverian border, all three of them are arrested by the U.S. Army for violating the treaty with Doom. Wildstreak helps them out when former captive Simon Ryker works for Project Alpha on Doom's behalf. Red Hulk manages to defeat Ryker's Warwolf form.

## Powers and abilities

Marvel editor Mark Paniccia described the Red Hulk as "absolutely uninhibited, tactically intelligent", while writer Jeph Loeb said "The Red Hulk is the kind of Hulk we haven't seen before—a thinking, calculating, brutal weapon-toting kind of Hulk." To further distance the character away from the original: "Everything the Green Hulk isn't, the Red Hulk is. Except, of course, for his powers which are identical. And he looks the same, except he's red. And he's the same size. But other than that, they're complete opposites." The character has abilities almost identical to those of the Hulk. The character can also emit heat at will from his eyes during non-enraged periods and can augment power levels by absorbing various types of energy, such as gamma radiation and the Power Cosmic. When infected with Cable's techno-organic virus during the "X-Sanction" storyline, he was able to control this heat to burn the virus out of his system. Red Hulk was created through a combination of gamma radiation and cosmic rays. The satellites used to revert the Hulk to human form at the end of World War Hulk were used to power the device used to turn Ross into the Red Hulk. Unlike the green Hulk, the Red Hulk does not revert to human form when rendered unconscious, and his blood is a fluorescent yellow instead of green, remaining that color even in human form. Unlike the green Hulk, who gets stronger as his rage increases, Red Hulk's body temperature rises with his anger. Though the heat is intense enough to melt desert sand into glass, it causes him to weaken when it becomes too intense, as his physiology lacks a cooling mechanism to deal with the excess heat. Red Hulk has also been shown to have a weakness to Negative Zone energy, which caused him burning pain and drained him when he attempted to absorb it.

## Reception

In 2009, Thunderbolt Ross was ranked as IGN's 71st Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.

### Red Hulk reception

Comics featuring the Red Hulk sold well but received mixed reviews. The first five issues of the 2008 Hulk title sold out, and second printings featured new covers. Issue #6 was the second-best-selling title of September 2008, and issue #10 was sixth in February 2009.
Augie De Blieck Jr. of Comic Book Resources gave the first six issues a positive review, describing it as a "silly fun action romp" and a "popcorn comic". De Blieck liked Loeb's lack of subtlety when giving out clues, saying "this is a book where anytime someone is about reveal the solution to the big mystery, they get knocked out by a slap in the face from the Red Hulk or a machine gun to the gut." His one criticism was that, although he liked the artwork, he would have preferred Dale Keown as the artist.
In 2012 Red Hulk was listed as #41 on IGN's "Top 50 Avengers". IGN reviewer Jesse Schedeen was generally critical of the series, citing a lack of character development and the emphasis on action over the ongoing question of Red Hulk's identity. Schedeen also derided the treatment of other mainstream Marvel characters within the pages of Hulk, saying about issue #5 "The series has already treated She-Hulk and Iron Man like ragdolls who crumple under the awesome might of Red Hulk. Now it's Thor's turn". Schedeen disliked the series for its poor dialogue, pacing, and characterization, and stated that Ed McGuinness' artwork was its only saving grace.
