## Other versions

An alternate timeline version of the Guardians of the Galaxy appears in the Ultimate Universe imprint. This version of the group originates from the 61st century, an utopian future in which about 250,000 Guardians protect millions of worlds, integrating the Shi'ar Imperial Guard to their ranks and ending threats such as the Ultron Dominion and the Celestials. The Guardians consist of Captain Marvel, Star-Lord, Ultimate Nullifier, and Cosmo Starstalker as well as Starhawk, Yondu, Charlie-27, Aleta Ogord, Martinex, an unidentified Captain Universe, Star Brand, Giraud the Phoenix, Molecule Boy, Gladiator, Major Victory, Fang, Hobgoblin, Magique, Manta, Starbolt, Titan, Gary (who wields the Infinity Gauntlet), and several unidentified members. America Chavez was previously a member of the Guardians until she was displaced in time and rendered amnesiac. After Captain Universe detects a temporal crisis, Starhawk, Yondu, Charlie-27, Aleta Ogord, and Martinex are dispatched to investigate the past. Martinex, the sole survivor, returns to his time and warns of Maker's tampering with reality before shattering. Though they try to preserve their time period and escape outside of time, the Guardians are attacked by Kang's clone army. Their ship is destroyed, displacing the survivors across time. When the Guardians of the Galaxy arrive in the Ultimates' time and find that America is amnesiac, they caution them that the Maker will return more powerful and that Doom may be the end of them. Before the Guardians of the Galaxy leave to find their displaced members, Captain Marvel gives America a temporal flare for use if they need them.
During a mission in the Superflow, Gary and Giraud are killed when the Galan Fields collapse. Months later, Captain Marvel, Ultimate Nullifier, and Cosmo Starstalker meet with the respective crews of the Hodmimis Holt and the Taripay Pacha, consisting of Herald, Kid Korvac, MODOS (Mental Organism Designed Only for Sorcery), Technarch, and D'arragh the Oldstrong. The Guardians have constructed two new timeships to aid them in their search for their displaced members. Captain Marvel states that Star-Lord is elsewhere looking for the Madrox as Herald claims that he previously saw the Madrox die. They managed to find throughout the timelines a Beyonder version of Daredevil and Ultron-82 who uses the Uatu alias while finding out in 13,000,000 BC on Moord that Chuurd (who operated as Nova Prime) has been long dead. When Star-Lord returns, he vomits out the Madrox, which is revealed to be a colony of microorganisms that had been living inside him. Cosmo detects Cyttorex's scent in the 30th century as they go to find him.
