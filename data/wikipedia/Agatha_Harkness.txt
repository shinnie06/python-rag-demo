## Fictional character biography

### 1970s

Agatha Harkness was introduced as the governess of Franklin Richards. She easily fended off the Frightful Four when they came to abduct Richards, and admitted to the Fantastic Four that she is a witch. She then aided the Fantastic Four in battle against Annihilus.
Through the actions of her son Nicholas Scratch, she was revealed as a member of the previously unknown New Salem, Colorado, a colony of witches of whom she had been the leader. Scratch had taken control of the town and persuaded its inhabitants that Agatha betrayed the community's secrets by working for the Fantastic Four. She was abducted and taken back to the community with Franklin to stand trial. The Fantastic Four followed and came into conflict with Salem's Seven, Agatha's grandchildren fathered by Scratch. The Fantastic Four defeated them and freed Agatha. In the process, Scratch's evil was revealed to the community of New Salem and he was banished to another dimension. Agatha became the magical tutor for the Scarlet Witch in the use of witchcraft.
Scratch and Salem's Seven returned, and Agatha foiled their attempt to conquer the world.

### 1980s

Eventually, Salem's Seven took over the New Salem community again. They captured Agatha and killed her by burning her at the stake, although Agatha soon made her presence known to Wanda in what appeared to be a post-death astral form. In an ensuing battle between the Scarlet Witch and Salem's Seven, the entire community's energies were drawn into Vertigo of the Seven, who lost control of them. Wanda managed to capture some of the energy and funnel it away, but the entire town was destroyed. Following hints from Agatha's astral form, Wanda channeled the remaining energy to become pregnant with twin children of Vision, her android husband.
Later, Agatha resurfaced, again alive and well, when Wanda's infant children began exhibiting odd behavior (disappearing for brief periods of time) and Wanda became unstable after her husband's dismantling; Agatha provided no explanation for her return. After Mephisto claimed that Scarlet Witch's children were actually fragments of his own soul and reabsorbs them, Agatha briefly mind-wiped Wanda's memory of her children in an attempt to help her deal with the trauma. Agatha later restored those memories soon after when Wanda became a pawn in a complex plot by Immortus. Agatha aided the Avengers in their battle against Immortus.

### 2000s

#### "Avengers Disassembled"

Wanda, again having no memory of her children, angrily confronted Agatha about their existence. Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. found what appeared to be Agatha's corpse in her home and concluded that Agatha had been dead for a long time. Some time later, a partially amnesiac Wanda tells Clint Barton she is under the care of her "Aunt Agatha" in a small apartment. However, this version of Wanda was later revealed to be a Doombot that replaced the real Wanda at some point.

#### Ghost life

Agatha has since made her presence known in the New Multiverse as a ghost. She appears to Wanda and confirms her death at the hands of her protégé. She also concurrently serves as the omniscient narrator of Vision's ongoing solo title, having induced precognitive visions through an arcane ritual involving the murder of Ebony at some undetermined point before her death. Agatha fights alongside Wanda and the spirit of her biological mother Natalya Maximoff against a physical manifestation of Chaos which is attempting to destroy witchcraft. The two spirits channel their magic through Wanda and, after Quicksilver is summoned, they manage to defeat the being once and for all although this has gravely wounded Order, the Goddess of Witchcraft. Natalya sacrifices herself to restore Order and, in doing so, also returns Agatha to life. Despite noting that her and Wanda's paths are intertwined, Agatha chooses to have some time to herself to enjoy being alive again.

### 2020s

#### The Daughters of Liberty

Agatha Harkness later appears as a member of the Daughters of Liberty where she taught magic to its members. At the time when Captain America figured out that Dryad is a revived Peggy Carter, Agatha teleported herself to inform him that the threats that the Daughters of Liberty have been facing are connected with Aleksander Lukin's sister Alexa. Agatha later briefed the Daughters of Liberty's latest recruit Shuri about the situation involving Selene having Sharon Carter's soul. She then proceeded to transport herself, Sharon's Iron Patriot appearance, and Shuri to where Selene is located.

#### Midnight Suns

During the battle with Corina (now calling herself Korrosion), a gigantic explosion of energy was unleashed due to the Black Mirror's destruction and neither Korrosion or Agatha Harkness were anywhere to be found. It later turns out that the explosion had sent them back to their homeworlds where they belong. Agatha discovers that by absorbing the Mirror's energy, she has been restored to her physical and mental prime and is now a young woman again. She briefly goes into hiding as she adjusts to her new body.

#### Restoring the Darkhold

During the "Contest of Chaos" storyline, Agatha uses Chthon's remains to create a new Darkhold and starts by having Spider-Man and Wolverine fight each other in the Amazon rainforest. Wolverine wins because Spider-Man held back and he gives Agatha the orb as they both disappear. Then Iron Man and Storm find themselves fighting each other in Giant Crystal Cave due to Agatha's spell which ends with Storm defeating Iron Man. Human Torch is transported to a moving train made to look like Hell, where Agatha's spell makes Human Torch and Ghost Rider fight each other. Human Torch defeats Ghost Rider as Agatha locks Human Torch up. While hunting the Jersey Devil, Moon Knight encounters Taegukgi and Agatha's spell makes them fight each other. This ends with Moon Knight surrendering. While somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle, Agatha is attacked by demons who found out that she is trying to recreate the Darkhold. Agatha summons Wolverine, Storm, Human Torch, and Taegukgi to fight them. Ghost-Spider fights White Fox in a Haikyu which ends with White Fox winning. Clea hears about what happened from Spider-Man and heads to the Amazon rainforest and finds that someone is using chaos magic. Clea is knocked out and ends up in the Astral Plane, where she encounters Agatha. Agatha's magic makes Deadpool and Dylan Brock possessed by the Venom symbiote fight each other at Hopper Land amusement park in the United Kingdom, which ends with Venom winning. After a brief battle with Clea on the Astral Plane, Agatha returns to her body in the Bermuda Triangle while in the presence of her champions. Agatha's magic makes Cyclops and Captain Marvel fight each other in an abandoned Iceland town, which ends with Captain Marvel surrendering. Clea figures out that Agatha is recreating the Darkhold using the energy of her champions causing Spider-Man to contact the Avengers. When the Avengers arrive in the Bermuda Triangle, Agatha unleashes her possessed champions on them. Captain Marvel and Scarlet Witch run into Agatha as they try to reason with her. When Agatha drops the newly created Darkhold and Captain Marvel drops it, an explosion happens. Agatha's body is nowhere to be found. On another beach, Agatha witnesses the Darkhold take on a sentient form which is slowly getting powerful.
During the "Blood Hunt" storyline, Agatha and the Darkhold's human form are traveling on a train incognito as they are being pursued by Scarlet Witch. Agatha poses as the Darkhold's mother during the trip. The Darkhold flees from Agatha and escapes into a river.
