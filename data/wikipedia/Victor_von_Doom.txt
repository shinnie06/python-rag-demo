# Doctor Doom

Doctor Doom is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The Fantastic Four #5 (1962), and has since endured as the archenemy of the superhero team the Fantastic Four.
Victor Werner von Doom is the monarch of the fictional European country of Latveria who uses his mastery of both science and sorcery in pursuit of his goals to bring order to humanity through world domination, and prove his intellectual superiority over Mister Fantastic—his old college rival and the leader of the Fantastic Four. Doom blames Mister Fantastic for his disfigurement, and wears a magically-forged suit of armor with a metal mask and green hooded cloak to conceal his facial scars. Regarded as one of the smartest characters and greatest threats in the Marvel Universe, Doom has stolen the abilities of cosmic beings such as the Silver Surfer and the Beyonder in his lust for power, although his pride and arrogance frequently lead to the failures of his schemes of conquest. Despite this, Doom's diplomatic immunity as ruler of Latveria prevents him from being charged for his crimes. While his primary obsession is the Fantastic Four, Doom has also fought other heroes, including Spider-Man, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, the X-Men, and the Avengers.
The character has been listed among the greatest comic book villains ever created and adapted in various media incarnations, including films, television series, and video games. Joseph Culp, Julian McMahon, Toby Kebbell, and Robert Downey Jr. have portrayed Doom in live-action.

## Publication history

### Creation and development

Like many of Marvel's Silver Age characters, Doom was conceived by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. With the Fantastic Four title performing well, Lee and Kirby were trying to dream up a "soul-stirring...super sensational new villain" for the series. Looking for a name, Lee latched onto "Doctor Doom" as "eloquent in its simplicity — magnificent in its implied menace."
Due to the rush to publish, the character was not given a full origin story until Fantastic Four Annual #2, two years after his debut.
Kirby stated in a 1987 interview: "Dr. Doom was the classic conception of Death, of approaching Death. I saw Dr. Doom as The Man in the Iron Mask, who symbolized approaching Death. It was the reason for the armor and the hood. Death is connected with armor and inhuman-like steel. Death is something without mercy and human flesh contains that element of mercy. Therefore, I had to erase it, and I did it with a mask."
Kirby further described Doom as being "paranoid", wrecked by his twisted face and wanting the whole world to be like him. Kirby went on to say that "Doom is an evil person, but he's not always been evil. He was [respected]...but through a flaw in his own character, he was a perfectionist." At one point in the 1970s, Kirby drew his interpretation of what Doom would look like under the mask, giving Doom only "a tiny scar on his cheek". Due to this slight imperfection, Doom hides his face not from the world, but from himself. To Kirby, this is the motivation for Doom's vengeance against the world; because others are superior due to this slight scar, Doom wants to elevate himself above them. Stan Lee's writing typically showed Doom's arrogance as his constant downfall, and how his pride leads to von Doom's disfigurement at the hands of his own machine, and to the failures of many of his schemes.
While the Fantastic Four had fought various villains such as the Mole Man, Skrulls, the Miracle Man, and Namor the Sub-Mariner, Doom managed to overshadow them all and became the Fantastic Four's archnemesis. During the 1970s, Doom branched out to more Marvel titles such as Astonishing Tales, The Incredible Hulk, and Super-Villain Team-Up (1975). Beginning with issue #42, he also had appearances in Marvel Team-Up (February 1976). Doom's origin was also a feature in Astonishing Tales when his ties to the villain Mephisto were revealed.
In the book Superhero: The Secret Origin of a Genre, Peter Coogan writes that Doom's original appearance was representative of a change in the portrayal of "mad scientists" to full-fledged villains, often with upgraded powers. These supervillains are genre-crossing villains who exist in adventures "in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended"; characters such as Professor Moriarty, Count Dracula, Auric Goldfinger, Hannibal Lecter, Joker, Lex Luthor, and Darth Vader, also fit this description. Sanderson also found traces of William Shakespeare's characters Richard III and Iago in Doom; all of them "are descended from the 'vice' figure of medieval drama", who address the audience in monologs detailing their thoughts and ambitions.

### 1980s–1990s

In 1976, Marvel and DC Comics collaborated on Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man, and seeking to replicate that success the two companies again teamed the characters in Superman and Spider-Man in 1981. Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter co-wrote the story with Marv Wolfman, and recalled choosing Victor von Doom based on his iconic status: "I figured I needed the heaviest-duty bad guy we had to offer — Doctor Doom. Their greatest hero against our greatest villain."
In 1981 John Byrne began his six-year run writing and illustrating Fantastic Four, sparking a "second golden age" for the title but also attempting to "turn the clock back [...] get back and see fresh what it was that made the book great at its inception." Doctor Doom made his first appearance under Byrne's tenure with issue #236. Whereas Kirby had intimated that Doom's disfigurement was more a figment of Victor's vain personality, Byrne decided that Doom's face was truly ravaged: only Doom's own robot slaves are allowed to see the monarch without his helmet. Byrne emphasized other aspects of Doom's personality; despite his ruthless nature, Victor von Doom is a man of honor. Returning to Latveria after being temporarily deposed, Doctor Doom abandons a scheme to wrest mystical secrets from Doctor Strange to oversee his land's reconstruction. Despite a tempestuous temper, Doom occasionally shows warmth and empathy to others; he tries to free his mother from Mephisto and treats Kristoff Vernard like his own son. Byrne gave further detail regarding Doom's scarring: Byrne introduced the idea that the accident at Empire State University only left Victor with a small scar that was exaggerated into a more disfiguring accident by Doom's own arrogance—by donning his newly forged face mask before it had fully cooled, he caused massive irreparable damage.
After his debut, Doctor Doom remained a key villain in Fantastic Four throughout the 1980s, appearing in titles as Punisher, The Spectacular Spider-Man, and Excalibur. During Steven Englehart's run on Fantastic Four, Doom was exiled by his heir, Kristoff, but this storyline was left unresolved when Englehart departed. Walt Simonson's Fantastic Four #350 controversially revealed that the Doom seen during Englehart's arc was a robotic imposter, with the real Doom returning in new armor to reclaim Latveria. Simonson's retcon suggested the last true appearance of Doom was in the "Battle of the Baxter Building," but later writers often disregarded his interpretations, leading to further revisions of Doom's character and history.

### 2000s–2010s

Mark Waid began to redefine Doctor Doom in the 2003 "Unthinkable" storyline (Fantastic Four vol. 3, #66-70 and #500), where Doom forsakes technology for mysticism. He kills his first love, Valeria, to gain powers from demons and imprisons Franklin Richards in Hell. Doom challenges Reed Richards to escape a magical prison, but with Doctor Strange's help, Richards succeeds, causing Doom to be dragged to Hell. Doom remained there until the 2004 "Ragnarok" storyline in Thor, where Thor's hammer, Mjölnir, provided his escape. In 2005–2006, Doctor Doom starred in the limited series Books of Doom, written by Ed Brubaker. This retelling of his origin explored the early, less-seen parts of Doom's life and questioned whether his path to dictatorship was fated or due to personal faults—a nature versus nurture debate. Brubaker's portrayal was influenced by the original Lee/Kirby version, and he chose not to show Doom's face, following Kirby's example.
In Spider-Man/Fantastic Four #4, the Mighty Avengers invaded Latveria due to Victor's involvement in a chemical bomb plot involving the Venom symbiote, which was actually orchestrated by Kristoff Vernard. In the Siege storyline, Doctor Doom initially supports Norman Osborn's attack on Asgard but later withdraws. He also stars in Doomwar written by Jonathan Maberry, where he allies with the isolationist Desturi to seize control of Wakanda.
In Fantastic Four: Three, Doctor Doom seeks to be "reborn" and plans to abdicate his throne to Kristoff. Valeria von Doom visits him, notices his brain damage, and offers to restore his mental capacity in exchange for his help with Reed and the Fantastic Four. A humbled Doom later attends Johnny Storm's funeral, and is recommended for the Future Foundation. Leading up to Secret Wars, Doom usurps the power of the Beyonders, creating a new Battleworld where he assumes the role of God. However, Reed Richards and a group of heroes challenge Doom, and with the Molecule Man's help, they restore the multiverse. Reed ultimately uses the Beyonder's power to heal Doom's face and purify his soul.
Doom returns to his kingdom, saving Tony Stark from Latverian rebels and claiming to be a new man. He relinquishes his dictatorship, entrusting Tony with a Wand of Watoomb to defeat Madame Masque. When more rebels appear, he teleports Stark to the Bronx Zoo, and they later confront Madame Masque in Chicago. After discovering she's possessed, Doom helps Tony trap her in his armor and exorcises the demon. He then vanishes before Tony wakes up. Doom later interrupts Tony's breakfast with Amara, trying to prove he has changed, but Tony remains distrustful. Following Stark's coma caused by Captain Marvel, Doom takes up the Iron Man mantle, faces Mephisto disguised as the Maker, joins the Avengers, and eventually conceives a child with Dr. Amara Perera.
When Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm seek their teammates to restore the Fantastic Four's powers, Doom follows them into parallel universes to assist an alternate Reed Richards against a version of Doom who has merged with Galactus. Meanwhile, Gwenpool, unaware of Doom's reformation, tries to attack him using an AI Doombot named Vincent. Doom easily captures her but is amused by her taunts. Gwen escapes, believing Doom is still a threat, and attacks again, releasing an earlier version of Doom. Doom defeats his doppelganger to save Gwen, who realizes her mistake and hopes for reform. Later, she enlists Doom, Vincent, Doctor Strange, and Terrible Eye to help her friend Cecil regain human form.
Doctor Doom was featured in his first solo series in 2019. Doom is framed for a Moon space station explosion he had warned about, while also experiencing random encounters with rival supervillain Kang the Conqueror due to a theorized quantum entanglement.

## Fictional character biography

Victor von Doom was born in Latveria to a tribe of Romani people under the rule of an unnamed nobleman, the Baron. His mother, the witch Cynthia Von Doom, died at the hands of Mephisto when Victor was young. His father, Werner von Doom, a renowned medicine man, kept her sorcery a secret to protect Victor. After Cynthia's death, the Baron's wife fell ill, and when Werner failed to save her, he was labeled a murderer and forced to flee with young Victor. Werner ultimately died of exposure on a mountainside, leaving Victor to discover his mother's occult instruments and swear revenge on the Baron. As Victor grew, he became a brilliant inventor, merging sorcery and technology to defend the Roma people. His exploits attracted the attention of the dean of Empire State University, who offered him a chance to study in the U.S., prompting Victor to leave his homeland and his love, Valeria, behind.
Upon arriving in the United States, Victor von Doom met Reed Richards, his future rival. He built a machine to communicate with the dead, specifically his mother, but ignored Richards’ warnings about its flaws, leading to a catastrophic explosion that severely damaged his face. Expelled after the incident, Victor traveled until he collapsed on a Tibetan mountainside, where he was rescued by monks. Mastering their disciplines, he forged an iron mask that permanently bonded to his skin, adopting the identity of Doctor Doom. As Doom, he sought revenge on those he held responsible for his accident, particularly Reed Richards, and successfully led a revolution to take over Latveria.

### 1960s

In his first appearance, Doctor Doom captures the Invisible Girl, using her as a hostage to force the Fantastic Four to travel back in time to steal Blackbeard's enchanted treasure to help him conquer the world. However, Reed Richards tricks Doom by swapping the treasure for worthless chains. Doom then allies with the Sub-Mariner, who installs a magnetic device in the Baxter Building to pull them into space, aiming to eliminate the Fantastic Four. The Sub-Mariner returns the Baxter Building to New York, leaving Doom stranded on an asteroid. After learning the secrets of the advanced Ovoids, Doom swaps consciousnesses with Mister Fantastic but accidentally switches back, ending up trapped in Sub-Atomica when hit by a shrinking ray he intended for the Fantastic Four. Doom takes over this micro-world but is ousted by the Fantastic Four and thrown into space while trying to send them there. Saved by Rama-Tut, he returns to Earth and uses a special berry juice to turn the Fantastic Four against each other. However, Richards outsmarts Doom with the hallucinogenic juice, leading Doom to believe he has killed him and depart. During the 1960s, Doom attempted to recruit Spider-Man into joining forces with him, and he came into conflict with the Avengers when Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch illegally entered Latveria to find a long-lost relative of theirs. He stole the Silver Surfer's powers in 1967, but lost them after breaching a barrier Galactus had set for the Surfer on Earth.

### 1970s and 1980s

During the 1970s, Doctor Doom expanded into more Marvel titles, featuring a battle for the Latverian throne against Prince Rudolfo in Astonishing Tales. In August 1981, he appeared in Iron Man, where Stark thwarted Doom's time-travelling plan to enlist Morgan le Fay to defeat King Arthur's forces with an army of revived warriors. Stranded in the past due to this interference, Doom vowed revenge, but he had to postpone it to return to the present day.
Doctor Doom later allies with the Puppet Master to trap the Fantastic Four in the miniature city of "Liddleville," using cybernetic copies of their bodies. However, he sabotages the plan to disrupt Reed's focus, but the Puppet Master ultimately aids the FF in escaping, trapping Doom in the android body he used to monitor them.
During John Byrne's 1980s run, Doctor Doom attempted to steal Terrax the Tamer's cosmic powers, leading to a fight that destroyed his body. He survived by transferring his consciousness to another human and was later restored to his original body by the Beyonder. On Battleworld, Doom briefly succeeded in stealing the Beyonder's power, but it was too vast for him to control, allowing the Beyonder to reclaim it.

### 1990s

When Franklin Richards was kidnapped by Onslaught, Doctor Doom joined forces with the Fantastic Four, Avengers and the X-Men to battle him in Central Park. During the fight, Doom was forced to sacrifice himself alongside others to contain Onslaught, which allowed the X-Men to destroy him. Though believed dead, Doom and the heroes were saved by Franklin, who created a pocket dimension called Counter-Earth, where Doom later uncovered a secret power linked to Franklin and persuaded the boy to relinquish control of the world.

### 2000s

When Susan Richards faced complications with her second pregnancy, Johnny Storm contacted Doctor Doom for help, knowing he couldn't resist the chance to outdo Reed. Doom saved Susan's daughter and cured Johnny's inability to "flame off" by channeling Johnny's excess energy into her. Afterward, Doom named the baby "Valeria" and plotted to make her his familiar. His lust for power led to him sacrifice his long-lost love Valeria to demons for magical powers equivalent to years of sorcery study. With this power, he trapped Franklin in Hell, immobilized Doctor Strange, and neutralized the Fantastic Four. However, Reed freed Doctor Strange's astral self, allowing them to outsmart Doom and provoke his demonic benefactors to take him to Hell.
To eliminate Doom as a threat, Reed took control of Latveria to dismantle his equipment, and planned to trap them both in a pocket dimension. This backfired when the team intervened, leading Doom to transfer his spirit into Sue, Johnny, and Ben. Reed was forced to kill Ben to stop Doom. Doom returned to Hell, and Reed later used a machine Doom had once created to travel to Heaven and restore Ben to life. Doom remained in Hell until he escaped during a dimensional tear caused by Mjölnir's fall to Earth, though he focused on rebuilding his power base instead of lifting the hammer. These events were later removed from Marvel continuity in the 2015 Secret Wars.
Later, a Doombot was defeated by Reed Richards, Hank Pym, Iron Man, and She-Hulk in New York City, raising questions about Doom's involvement. In the midst of the superhero Civil War, he sends a message to Storm and the Black Panther, inviting an alliance between Latveria and Wakanda. In Latveria, Panther spurns the invitation, detonating an EMP that blacked out a local portion of Latveria before Doctor Doom's robots could destroy his ship. It is later revealed that Doom is working with the Red Skull on a weapon, believing it would lead him to become the Baron of Iron, despite his disagreements with the Skull's principles.
At the end of the first chapter of the X-Men event "Endangered Species", Doom is contacted by Beast to help reverse the effects of Decimation but rejects the offer, admitting he lacks talent in genetics. In Spider-Man: One More Day, Doom is approached by Spider-Man for help in saving Aunt May. Additionally, he transforms Latveria into a refugee camp for Atlanteans after the destruction of their kingdom, and allies with Loki to manipulate his brother into unwittingly releasing his Asgardian allies.
Doctor Doom later defends Latveria against the Mighty Avengers after it is revealed that one of his satellites carried the 'Venom Virus' released in New York City, a result of hacking by one of Doom's enemies. During a battle with Iron Man and the Sentry, the time travel mechanism in his armor overloads, trapping them all in the past; Doom continues his relationship with Morgan le Fay using his time machine. Although he and Iron Man eventually return to the present, Doom leaves Iron Man in his exploding castle and is falsely incarcerated at the Raft. He later escapes the Raft in the "Secret Invasion" storyline, thanks to a virus was uploaded into the prison's systems by the Skrulls.
After the Secret Invasion and the onset of "Dark Reign," Doctor Doom joined the Cabal with Norman Osborn, Emma Frost, Namor, Loki's female form, and the Hood, seeking revenge for his tarnished reputation. Quasimodo researched Doctor Doom for Norman Osborn. He advises Norman to not trust Doctor Doom despite being a man of honesty and to treat his alliance with him with utmost care.
Soon after, he allies with the isolationist Desturi to seize control of Wakanda. Doom severely injures T'Challa, the Black Panther, aiming to take Wakanda's vibranium for his own enhancement. However, T'Challa destroys the vibranium stockpile, believing his people can survive without it. In Fantastic Four #566-569, written by Mark Millar, Doctor Doom receives a power upgrade after being thrown back in time by the Marquis of Death. He fights through time to seek revenge, claiming to have rebuilt himself to destroy the Marquis. However, later issues ignore this arc, suggesting it was merely a dream of Valeria von Doom. Doom then joins the supervillain group Intelligencia but is betrayed and captured during their plan. He escapes with Bruce Banner's help and returns to Latveria, seemingly damaged by the experience.

### 2010s

At the start of the "Siege" storyline, Doom, working with the Cabal, demands that Osborn reverse his actions against Namor, but Osborn refuses. After a violent attack by the Void, it's revealed that the "Doctor Doom" present was actually a Doombot, which releases nanites that destroy Avengers Tower and force evacuations. The real Doom warns Osborn not to strike him again, threatening further consequences.
It's revealed that the Scarlet Witch at Wundagore Mountain is a Doombot, indicating that the real Wanda was captured by Doom after the House of M event. Wanda's enhanced powers resulted from her and Doom's attempt to channel the Life Force to resurrect her children, which ultimately overwhelmed her. With Wiccan's help, they sought to use the entity possessing Wanda to restore mutant powers, but the Young Avengers intervened, concerned about the consequences. Doom aimed to transfer this entity into himself, gaining god-like powers, but accidentally killed Cassie before Wanda and Wiccan could reclaim those powers from him.
In "Fantastic Four: Three," a guilt-ridden Doctor Doom, planning to abdicate his throne to Kristoff, is approached by Valeria, who asks for his help with her father. Noticing Doom's brain damage and memory loss from a previous battle, she offers to restore his mental faculties in exchange for assisting with the Fantastic Four, which he agrees to. Later, Doom attends Johnny Storm's funeral. Due to this agreement, Doom is recommended by Nathaniel and Valeria von Doom to join the Future Foundation. Despite an angry attack from the Thing, Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman welcome him. Valeria learns that Kristoff Vernard is Doom's backup for restoring his memories, so they all head to Latveria, where a brain transfer machine successfully restores Doom's knowledge. Although Kristoff offers to return the throne to Doom, he declines, citing a promise to Valeria to help her defeat Mister Fantastic when needed. Doom then plans a symposium to defeat the Council of Reeds—alternate versions of Reed Richards trapped in their universe. Mister Fantastic, Victor, Valeria, and Nathaniel Richards meet with the supervillain geniuses and Uatu the Watcher about what to do with the Council of Reeds.
Around this time, von Doom performed brain surgery on the Hulk to separate him from Bruce Banner, extracting the uniquely Banner elements from the Hulk's brain and cloning a new body for Banner, in return for a favor from the Hulk. This clone is killed soon afterward. Later, Doom is apparently killed by the Mad Celestials, but survives and creates the Parliament of Doom.
He later returns rule Latveria for a millennium. An ill-fated excursion into the alternate universe of the one of Infinity Gauntlets resulted in Reed and Nathaniel Richards rescuing Doom from his own council.
During the confrontation between the Avengers and the X-Men, Doom allies with Magneto and others against Red Skull's Red Onslaught form. In an attempt to atone for past misdeeds, Doom absorbs the Scarlet Witch reality-altering powers and resurrects the dead Cassie Lang, whom he had accidentally killed. He subsequently makes a Faustian deal with an unspecified demon to resurrect Brother Voodoo. After returning to normal, Doom is taken into captivity for his initial killing of Lang.
As the final Incursion approaches in the Secret Wars storyline, Doom usurps the power of the Beyonders with the aid of Doctor Strange and the Molecule Man. He then creates a new Battleworld from the destroyed multiverse, claiming the role of God, and rewriting history to resurrect those he killed, while taking Sue as his wife and assigning roles to Franklin and Valeria. Ultimately, Reed and a group of survivors challenge Doom, and with Molecule Man's help, they restore the multiverse. Reed chooses to heal Doom's face using the Beyonder's power.
In the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Doom returns to Latveria and saves Tony Stark by using a sonic attack to incapacitate a group of rebels. He tells Tony he's a new man and gives him one of the Wands of Watoomb for protection against Madame Masque. When more rebels arrive, Doom teleports Iron Man to the Bronx Zoo, then to the Jackpot Club in Chicago to confront a Masque. Realizing she is demonically possessed, Doom has Tony trap her in the Iron Man armor while he exorcises the demon. He disappears before Tony regains consciousness, then later interrupts Tony's breakfast date with Amara to prove he has changed, but Tony remains distrustful and Doom leaves again, not without a little smooch though.
After Tony Stark's defeat by Captain Marvel in Civil War II, Doom discovers his calling to heal the world, reflecting on his dissatisfaction as a god. Inspired by Stark, he establishes Stark's legacy, fights for his brand of justice as the third Iron Man, and later conflicts with Mephisto disguised as Maker. Doom joins the Avengers and conceives a child with Dr. Amara Perera, prompting a group of villains led by the Hood to target him. The final battle occurs when the Hood tries to take over Stark Industries, leading to a confrontation between Doom and the Hood, during which Doom's face is severely burned by a demon. After the villains' defeat, Victor retreats to the ruins of Castle Doom.
A young woman named Zora Vokuvic breaks into Castle Doom, demanding to see Doctor Doom and insisting that Latveria needs its leader back amid turmoil. Initially resistant, Doom is persuaded when Zora hands him his iconic mask, prompting him to venture out and quell the civil war, vowing to restore the nation with his own strength.

### 2020s

Doctor Doom is framed for the destruction of the Antlion space station by Symkarian rebels and is killed while on the run, only to be sent back to Earth by Death as her "greatest servant." After fending off assassins including Taskmaster and MODOK, he sends Reed Richards his solution to the black hole threatening Earth and sets off to regain his power. During the "King in Black" storyline, Doctor Doom confronts Iron Man during Knull's invasion. Iron Man is bonded with an Extremis-powered Symbiote, and they are attacked by a Symbiote-possessed Santa Claus, revealed to be Mike Dunworthy. Doom seeks to learn from Iron Man's new armor, but is turned down, leaving him to ponder whether Santa Claus could be a Sorcerer Supreme.
During the "Blood Hunt" storyline, Doctor Doom puts Latveria on high alert amidst a vampire invasion, ordering border guards to maintain defenses while noting he will have new subjects to attend to. He later approaches Strange Academy students in Madripoor after the disappearance of Agatha Harkness and the Living Darkhold. At the Latverian embassy in Alberia, Doom saves Tatiana Keska from vampires, despite knowing she has grievances against him. Doctor Doom informs Doctor Strange and Clea that Blade is possessed by Varnae and declares they need mages to bring back the Sun, requesting the title of Sorcerer Supreme. After being temporarily granted the title, he casts a spell that removes the Darkforce surrounding Earth, which inadvertently allows vampires to walk in sunlight. However, he then betrays his promise and refuses to return the title, making Doctor Strange disappear.

## Powers and abilities

Considered to be one of the smartest men on Earth, Doom's high-level intellect rivals that of his sworn nemesis Reed Richards. Doom has notably restored the Thing's human form—though Reed Richards also achieved this, he struggled to maintain it. However, Richards managed to process complex calculations to save Kitty Pryde from disintegration, a feat Doom admitted he could not replicate. Doom has leveraged his scientific prowess to steal or replicate the powers of cosmic beings such as the Silver Surfer, the Beyonder, and even Galactus's world-ship. Doom often uses "Doombots," his robot doubles, to retroactively explain his actions or erase events from his history. This device was also used to depict Kristoff Vernard believing himself to be the real Doom for a time.
In addition to being a genius level scientist and inventor, Doom is also a very powerful sorcerer with a mastery of dark magic, giving him a unique advantage over his rival, Mister Fantastic. Initially trained by Tibetan monks, Doom's magical powers are later enhanced by his lover Morgan le Fay. The magical spells Doom casts grant him additional powers abilities including energy absorption and projection, technopathy, dimensional travel, healing, and is able to summon hordes of demonic creatures. Doom placed second in a magic tournament held by the ancient sorcerer the Aged Genghis, and after Doctor Strange relinquished the title of Sorcerer Supreme, he acknowledged Doom's potential to assume that role.
The alien Ovoids inadvertently taught Doom how to psionically transfer his consciousness into another being through eye contact. However, he rarely employs this ability, as it can revert if his concentration breaks, and he is reluctant to do so due to his ego about his appearance.
Doom's armor enhances his strength and durability to superhuman levels, allowing him to contend with more physically powerful foes like Spider-Man and the Hulk, although he prefers long-range tactics against stronger opponents. The armor is nearly indestructible, shielding him from various forms of manipulation and housing advanced weaponry, including lasers, a force field generator, and lethal electric shocks. Additionally, his armor supports him with air, food, water, and energy systems for extended periods in extreme environments such as outer space. Even without the armor, Doom is a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, capable of defeating strong opponents due to his knowledge of pressure points and skill with melee weapons.

### Monarch of Latveria

As the absolute monarch of Latveria, Doctor Doom rules the country with an iron fist and has frequently used his political power for his own personal benefit. Doom has reshaped the country in his own image, renaming both the capital city Hassenstadt and Castle Sabbat to Doomstadt and Castle Doom respectively. Doom frequently monitors the citizens of Latveria from Castle Doom and uses his Doombots to maintain order within his nation. Despite his infamous reputation as a supervillain, Doom has diplomatic immunity – allowing him to escape legal prosecution for most of his crimes he commits outside of Latveria. Doom also has total control of the nation's natural and technological resources, along with its manpower, economy, and military. Though from the outside it seems tyrannical, it seems the Latverian people really do adore Doom, as shown with two of his apprentices, Zora Vukovic, (aka, Victorious) and Kristoff Vernard. He is also known to harbor fugitive supervillains within Latveria as means of protecting them from prosecution, although he only does this for villains who play a part in his schemes. After renouncing his rulership, it is likely he lost this status.

### Psychology

Doom's primary weakness is his arrogance, which often blinds him to his own role in his failures. Layla Miller noted that he refuses to accept responsibility for the accident that scarred his face, instead blaming Reed Richards. While Doom typically views himself as superior, he occasionally listens to heroes like Mister Fantastic when it benefits him. Even when allied with others, he often seeks personal gain, as seen when he attempted to steal Thanos’ Infinity Gauntlet during a confrontation with the Titan. Doom adheres to a strict code of honor, keeping his word but often interpreting promises in a self-serving way. For instance, while he may not harm someone directly, he won't stop others from doing so. His sense of honor has led him to save Captain America and spare Spider-Man's life, but he refuses to attack weakened opponents, preferring that any victory over the Fantastic Four come solely from him. Despite his flaws, Doom is devoted to his subjects. When judged by the Panther God of Wakanda, it is revealed that Doom truly wished for a utopian future where humanity thrived, albeit one where he was in power.

## Inventions

Doctor Victor von Doom's genius in science and technology has allowed him to build numerous devices to handle enemies or acquire greater power. The most notable among them include:

### Doombots

Most Doombots are decoys of the real Doctor Doom. They are sometimes depicted without hoods to prevent readers from confusing them with the real Doom. They are used for many missions, typically those where he fears defeat, thus functioning as his version of a Life Model Decoy. The Doombots are programmed to believe themselves to be the real Doctor Doom unless they are in his presence.

### Servo-Guards

The Servo-Guards are robots that are programmed to attack the enemies of Doom.

### Time Platform

The Time Platform is Doctor Doom's time machine which features a 10-by-10-foot (3.0 by 3.0 m) platform and a control console, allowing transport to any point in Earth's timestream. He can return on his own using his armor's time circuitry, and one such machine was captured by the Fantastic Four, who used it to send Godzilla back in time.

### Empowerment Device

This unnamed device that was made on Battleworld was used by Doctor Doom to imbue people with superpowers like he did to Mary MacPherran and Marsha Rosenberg when they were turned into Titania and Volcana.

## Cultural influence and legacy

### Critical reception

UGO Networks described Doctor Doom as an iconic figure in Marvel Comics, known for his "iron mask and emerald cowl", along with his formidable armor and army of Doombots. George Marston from Newsarama described Doom as one of the "best Marvel supervillains," highlighting his intelligence, mastery of both science and magic, and his recent return to villainy in the Fantastic Four relaunch. David Harth of CBR.com referred to Doctor Doom as one of the "coolest Avengers villains," praising his charisma, distinctive speech, impressive armor, and rich backstory that adds depth to his character beyond typical villainy.

A ride called Doctor Doom's Fearfall is located at Islands of Adventure in the Universal Orlando Resort.

## Other versions

### 1602

In Neil Gaiman's alternative-universe tale, Marvel 1602, Dr. Doom is "Count Otto von Doom", also known as "Otto the Handsome". A mastermind genius of physics and even genetics, von Doom keeps the Four of the Fantastick imprisoned in his castle, continually tapping Richard Reed for knowledge. The Four eventually escape during an attack on Doom's castle by the other heroes of the time, which also leads to the scarring of his face.
Otto von Doom returns in 1602: The Fantastick Four, in which he plans to visit a city beyond the edge of the world, believing they have knowledge that could restore his face. He kidnaps William Shakespeare to record these events.

### Age of Apocalypse

In the Age of Apocalypse, Victor von Doom is an agent of the Human High Council and the Head of Security. His facial scar is the result of a mutant uprising in Latveria.

### Combat Colin

Doctor Doom made an appearance in Marvel UK's Combat Colin strip. A superheroes convention is attacked by the robotic Steamroller Man. After Combat Colin and his sidekick Semi-Automatic Steve defeats the robot, its controller is revealed to be Doctor Doom, who explains that after years of being defeated by American superheroes he thought (wrongly) he could stand a chance against some incompetent Brits. The final panel shows Doom back in his lair, surrounded by newspaper cuttings detailing his past defeats and wondering how he would do in a fight with Thomas the Tank Engine.

### Doom Supreme

In an alternate reality, Doctor Doom, known as Doom Supreme, became a master of dark arts after losing his beloved Valeria, using her remains to forge his armor through sacrifice. He also sacrificed alternate versions of himself to power his armor and intimidated others into allegiance, claiming to be "the Doom who breaks other Dooms."
Doom Supreme, after witnessing a battle between the Prehistoric Avengers and a younger Thanos, is advised by Mephisto to form a new Masters of Evil from the worst villains in the Multiverse to conquer it, saving Earth-616 for last. He assembles a powerful group, including Black Skull, Dark Phoenix, and her Berserkers, Ghost Goblin, Kid Thanos, and King Killmonger. They attack various Earths, eventually arriving on Earth-616.

### Earth-111

In this reality, visited by Ben Grimm while attempting to recover the coordinates of the Ultimate Nullifier, divided between the subconscious minds of four alternative Johnny Storms, Doom was the leader of the 'Challengers of Doom' consisting of himself, Reed Richard, Sue Storm, and the Hulk-, with Latveria having been destroyed in an unspecified past disaster and Doom relocating to New York to become a hero. When Galactus came to Earth and landed in Russia, Doom dismissed it as a hoax, prompting Grimm to note that this Doom was more arrogant than the version he knew as the Doom of Earth-616 was at least willing to listen to even his enemies if the situation was serious enough rather than dismiss their views as automatically irrelevant.

### Earth-1191

Unlike most Dooms this version is portrayed as an old, senile man with delusions of retaining his old authority and physique- seen by Layla Miller as a natural 'evolution' of Doom's inability to accept that he might be the reason for his failures-, although with periods of lucidity in which, while physically decrepit, he is still as smart and devious (and in turn, dangerous) as ever. Currently he's been taken in by Layla Miller and Jamie Madrox who hope that he can aid them in traveling back to their present. After finding and reactivating a time machine provided by the future X-Men, Doom, while in another lucid moment, betrays them, ordering the time traveling "Cortex" to use his abilities to "Destroy all the mutants". Doom also is able to take control of the heavily cyberized Cyclops though his cybernetic implants, forcing Cyclops' daughter Ruby to take him down. After this battle, Doom vanishes.

### Earth-691

In the alternate 31st century of the original Guardians of the Galaxy, designated as Earth-691, Doom is revealed to have somehow managed to place his brain inside the adamantium skeleton of Wolverine at some unknown point in the past, hiding this fact with a perfect replica of his original armor, cloak, hood, and simulated flesh intended to give the appearance that he has managed to prolong his life to unnatural lengths. He eventually comes face to face with Rancor, a descendant of Wolverine, and offers to become her ally, though he secretly intended to use her as a pawn for his own gain, while she intends to slay him on her quest to determine what happened to Wolverine. During their battle, Doom reveals himself to be in control of Wolverine's skeleton, heavily modified with cybernetics and missing half of one of the claws, which had eventually come into the possession of Rancor. Rancor manages to strike at one of Doom's robotic eyes, forcing him to retreat. Doom is not seen again in this reality.

### Earth-X

### House of M

In the House of M continuity, Doom rules Latveria, with his mother alive, married to Valeria, and having adopted Kristoff. After Reed Richards's test flight results in the deaths of Reed, Sue, and John Jameson from cosmic radiation, Ben Grimm survives but loses his intelligence. This prompts Doom to form the Fearsome Four with himself, the It (Grimm), the Invincible Woman (Valeria), and the Inhuman Torch (Kristoff). However, due to Doom's arrogance and brutality, the It betrays the team, leading to the deaths of Valeria and Kristoff, and his mother's kidnapping. Left broken, Doom genetically mutates himself, transforming his skin into liquid metal and gaining the ability to form weapons from his hands as he prepares for revenge.

### Iron Man 2093

In an alternative future set in 2093, where a reborn King Arthur rules a renewed Camelot, Doom and Iron Man are drawn to stop a plan to destroy most of Earth's population. While Iron Man battles his descendant wielding Excalibur, Doom confronts his future self, who has allied with the future Iron Man to complete a sinister plan. Rejecting his future counterpart, Doom asserts that no amount of power justifies such an affront to his dignity, then kills the older Doom, suggesting a stable time loop where the younger Doom will always defeat his future self.

### Marvel Mangaverse

In Marvel Mangaverse, Doom makes T'Channa, T'Challa's sister, his disciple, she banishes him to another dimension and assumes the identity of Doctor Doom.

### Marvel Two-In-One (2017)

When the Thing and the Human Torch search the multiverse for the missing Richards' family, their first new universe visited is a world where the Thing died in the Fantastic Four's first battle with Galactus. This universe's Doctor Doom saved Earth by transferring his mind into Galactus, with the result that Earth has been spared but Doom's hunger for power has led him to devour every other planet in the universe. With the help of alternate counterparts of Reed Richards and Emma Frost from an undesignated universe, they are able to defeat him by transferring his mind into Emma Frost's body, while she becomes the Life Bringer, inverting Galactus's nature as she uses Galactus's body to restore the planets Doom devoured.

### Marvel Universe vs the Avengers

Weeks after a pathogen has turned most of Earth's population into homicidal cannibals, Dr. Doom aids the Avengers in repelling the infected and offers them Doom Stones to prevent further transformations, but demands absolute loyalty in return. Most Avengers reluctantly accept, while Thor returns to Asgard; however, they later discover that the stones do not halt the infection but enhance cognitive function in the cannibals and accelerate the transformation process. Hawkeye uncovers Doom's infection and, after Doom activates the stones' harmful effects, he is ultimately killed by Hawkeye with an arrow tipped with Wolverine's severed adamantium claws.

### Marvel Zombies vs. The Army Of Darkness

In more of an anti-hero role, the Earth-2149 version of Doom is still ruler of Latveria. Doom has fortified his castle to defend against the infected superheroes and refuses help from Nick Fury, and takes in refugees for the purpose of repopulating the planet once the situation is resolved. To the disgust of his allies, it is revealed Doom has only chosen the hardiest breeding stock of the Latverian survivors; there are no elderly people or children. He creates a makeshift portal that will allow escape into other dimensions, should the zombie plague doom the planet. Doom is forced to vaporize the mutant Dazzler and the zombified Enchantress after the latter infects the former, but is then attacked by the zombified Marvel superheroes and infected by Reed Richards, who had infected himself and his teammates on purpose.
Shortly before he turns, a "dying" Doom heroically uses his portal to allow the refugees escape to another reality. Despite his defenses, the zombies breaks through once more. With only himself and Ash Williams remaining, he reveals he has been infected by the virus, and cannot go through the portal himself. Though tempted to eat Ash, he resists, as he considers Ash to have allowed him revenge against Reed Richards, allowing the man to escape, even giving him the ability to choose one of many realities. As Ash escapes through it, Doom ultimately destroys the device, trapping himself with the zombies. Having witnessed Doom saving the refugees by using his portal for their escape, the zombified Thing suddenly attacked Doom. He is later seen in New York, as a zombie who attempts to devour Galactus before engaging in battle with the zombified superheroes who succeeded in absorbing Galactus' cosmic powers before him, presumably being killed by them off-screen.

### MC2

In the Fantastic Five series set in the MC2, Doom is revealed to be held captive by the Sub-Mariner for ten years, after the destruction of Atlantis. Doom manages to escape, and uses the same device he once employed to imbue Terrax with the Power Cosmic on his Doombots- unable to use it on himself as his human body would be destroyed from the strain-, and attempts to take over the world. Taking advantage of Doom's desire to prove himself superior, Reed Richards challenges Doom to a psychic duel, using a device that will send the loser's mind to the Crossroads of Infinity. The two are so evenly matched that both are sent to the Crossroads - although Namor notes that it is possible that Reed sacrificed himself to try to save Doom - leaving their bodies as empty shells, although Reed's teammates note that there is always a possibility that the two shall return so long as their bodies remain alive.

### Mini-Marvels

Doctor Doom makes shortly cameos in Mini-Marvels. In the "Classic Mini Marvels" section, there's a short story about him in which he tries to read Marvel's comics.

### Mutant X

In the Mutant X universe, Doom leads the United Nations in battle against the Goblyn Queen and later the Beyonder.
An alternate of Doom with the powers of Charles Xavier is a superhero and leader of his own X-Men.

### Old Man Logan

In the alternative Wolverine-centric future shown on Earth-807128, the supervillains of the Marvel universe finally won and divided America (later renamed Amerika) up amongst themselves. Doctor Doom has his own area of land called New Latveria (also called Doom's Lair). He is seen for only a few panels dressed in all gray standing atop a cliff watching a now old Logan and Hawkeye driving the Spider Buggy built by the Human Torch. It is revealed that Clyde Wyncham has taken on the role of Doom.
On Earth-21923 that was similar to Earth-807128, Doctor Doom's history is still the same. After Old Man Logan killed Red Skull and Hulk, a power vacuum was caused in Amerika which led to Doctor Doom taking over the Presidential Quarter. At one point during his takeover of the Presidential Quarter, he came across a village that was established by Baron Mordo. When Doctor Doom cut off Baron Mordo's access to Agatha Harkness, he killed Baron Mordo, took the Darkhold that was in his possession, and freed Sofia Strange and those enslaved to Mordo. In addition, he allowed Agatha to leave with her life while stating that she owes him. When asked by Sofia on what he plans to do with the Darkhold, Doctor Doom states that he is going to use it to rule.

### Old Woman Laura

In the alternate timeline of Old Woman Laura, Doom gathered most of the supervillains on Earth into an army, attempting to conquer the world. When his "soldiers" were defeated and imprisoned, Doom retreated to Latveria, creating an impenetrable forcefield over the whole country. Decades later, Wolverine receives word that Doom is holding her clone sister Bellona prisoner, and leads a covert attack to take Doom out once and for all. Doom manages to capture Laura, revealing that he deliberately leaked the intel that drove her to attack. He attempts to transfer his mind into Laura's body in order to escape his own decrepit form, only to discover that Laura is herself dying. Doom returns to his own body, but is killed by Laura immediately after.

### Spider-Man: Life Story

In Spider-Man: Life Story, a reality in which the Marvel superheroes aged in real time and started their careers the same year as their publication, Doctor Doom has taken over Earth as a result of the Civil War between Captain America and Iron Man and a resistance being formed to combat him composed of those that did not die or disappear entirely.

### The End

In Alan Davis' mini-series, Fantastic Four: The End, Dr. Doom appears as a four-armed cyborg with little of his humanity left. Doom breaks during the "mutant wars" and is now a killing machine, focused on the deaths of the Fantastic Four. He engages in a final battle with the Four and is seemingly killed in an explosion when his powers react with those of Franklin and Valeria Richards. Doom is later revealed to be alive and conquers the Negative Zone after killing Annihilus and obtaining his power rod and immortality.

### The Last Fantastic Four Story

Dr. Doom is seen trying to destroy the Adjudicator, however he and his robotic planes are shown to disintegrate and he is last seen cheering the Fantastic Four (even though he will find a way to destroy them). How he survived remains unknown.

### Ultimate Marvel

In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Victor Van Damme, a descendant of Vlad Tepes Dracula, is part of the Baxter Building think tank alongside Reed Richards and Susan Storm. He secretly reprograms a teleporter's coordinates, causing the accident that gives the Ultimate Fantastic Four their powers and transforms him into a metallic-skinned figure with clawed hands and hooved legs. When he learns of their transformation, he derides Reed as a "freak," believing himself to be the only one worthy of such power.
For a time, Doom leads a micronation in Copenhagen known as "Free State," where citizens live rent-free in exchange for loyalty and receive dragon tattoos that serve as mind control devices. The Fantastic Four eventually liberate the citizens during their first battle, but they cannot imprison Doom due to his diplomatic immunity. During the Namor fiasco, it was revealed that the mother of Sue and Johnny Storm possesses a similar dragon tattoo. After the collapse of the Keep, Doom returned to Latveria and transformed it from a Third World nation into the ninth-richest country in the world within six months. Although the citizens, now bearing Doom's dragon tattoos, revere him as "the good doctor," their loyalty comes at a cost. Meanwhile, Doom switches bodies with Reed Richards to claim a life he believes is rightfully his, leaving Reed in control of Latveria while he seeks recognition by saving Johnny Storm from an alien parasite. Despite Reed's efforts to combat the zombie Fantastic Four, Doom ultimately reverts their bodies and defeats the threat himself.
The Ultimate Marvel version of Doom is a scientific genius who views science as an art, having transformed his body into solid metal and gained powers similar to Colossus, including the ability to expel his internal organs as poisonous gas and regenerate, though he cannot heal wounds inflicted by his own spikes. He exhibits super strength and can launch metal spikes from his forearms, making him formidable enough to break the arms of a zombie version of Ben Grimm. The Ultimate Universe's Doom is also an accomplished sorcerer.

### Venomverse

In Venomverse, Doom was consumed by the Poisons and became their second in command after Poison Thanos. He with the other Poison Heroes started battling the Army of Venoms in which he was the only survivor. Then the Poisons tried to invade Earth-616, he and Thanos along with the other Poisons got killed, after the Poison Queen was destroyed.

### Warlock

On the original Counter Earth, Victor von Doom is a genius, but not a villain. He appears in the original Warlock series. Doom's armor is now represented only by the metallic mask. He is referred to as "the most famous egghead in the country", the "like spirit-brother" of Reed Richards, and "a man as dedicated to counter-Earth's survival as Earth's von Doom is to its enslavement".
He and Reed Richards are mentioned in passing in Marvel Premiere #2 and Warlock #2 as scientists without any sort of super-powers.
In Warlock #6, it is told how von Doom and Richards had been roommates, friends and lab partners in college. After von Doom's disfiguring accident, Richards' emotional support prevented him from becoming a villain. When Richards and his three companions hijacked a spaceship in order to be the first humans in space, von Doom unsuccessfully attempted to talk him out of it. Though all of the counter "fantastic four" were exposed to cosmic radiation, it was only Richards that was affected due to the interference of Man-Beast though the effects only became apparent ten years later when he became the Brute due to "latent cosmic radiation - and a mysterious guiding hand".
In Warlock #5-7, Victor von Doom was employed at the Livermore Valley Lab in California where he worked on "Earth-Corer-1", a vehicle designed to tunnel into the Earth. He warned the president of a massive earthquake that would be caused by a nuclear bomb test. The resulting earthquake accidentally activated "Antipersonnel missiles, nicknamed deathbirds" which began killing people indiscriminately. Doom was able to destroy them with Adam Warlock's help, using one of his inventions called the "deactivator". He died while helping Warlock stop the Brute from absorbing all of Counter-Earth's geothermal energy, turning him back into Reed Richards.

### What If?

There are some "What If" stories revolving around Doctor Doom:

In What If Doctor Doom had become a Hero?, Victor Doom heeds Reed Richards' warnings, successfully using his machine to free his mother from Hell and becoming a hero who liberates Latveria. However, when Mephisto traps his nation and demands a soul for a soul, Doom sacrifices Valeria, choosing ambition over love, and spends his future fighting demons to reclaim her.
In What If Doctor Doom Were Sorcerer Supreme? a young Victor von Doom seeks the Ancient One to harness his magical potential, but his ambition leads to deadly rivalries with fellow student Mordo. Ultimately, the Ancient One attempts to curtail Doom's growing power by taking him to Mephisto's realm, where Doom dies but transfers his memories into Stephen Strange, shaping the future of magic.
In What if Doctor Doom had Become the Thing?, a scheming Victor von Doom sabotages Reed Richards' rocket project to further his own ambitions, ultimately using armor that amplifies cosmic rays and transforms him into the Thing. After a confrontation with Reed and the emergence of a hulk-like Ben Grimm, Doom is defeated and forced to retreat, facing the consequences of his manipulations.
In What If: Secret Wars, Doctor Doom, after defeating the Beyonder, eliminates Inhumans, Eternals and the remaining superheroes and establishes a utopia on Earth. After a lengthy battle with the Celestials, he restores Earth and reintroduces himself as "Victor," stepping back to guide humanity rather than rule over it.
In "What If: Iron Man: Demon in an Armor," Doctor Doom, after transferring his mind into Tony Stark's body, uses Stark's identity to build his own reputation while Stark, amnesic and believing himself to be Doom, creates a new life. Their eventual confrontation reveals the truth, but Stark refuses to switch back, having forged his own honorable identity despite Doom's actions.

### King Loki

In the future depicted in Loki: Agent of Asgard, Doctor Doom discovers Latveria completely destroyed after King Loki destroyed the Earth. Doom attempts to prevent this future by imprisoning the Loki of the present.

### Ultimate Universe

In Earth-6160, a world marked by alternate history due to the interference of the Maker, Latveria is an independent territory close to the European Coalition and used as his seat of political power, as he reshapes the global status quo, eroding national identities and independence in favor of a new world order, creating a Council composed of leaders of regional power blocs and creating a permanent war economy between their territories, while they operate covertly as a group, keeping their local populations controlled as a worldwide form of shadow government.
It is shown through Howard Stark's history files that the Maker arrived in 1963, establishing the futuristic enclave known as "The City" at Latveria, showcasing himself as a force of progress to the world and performing feats such as taking care of external threats like Galactus and performing a moon landing. He is regarded as an Imperator, or the de facto ruler of the Earth, due to being regarded as the only one capable of keeping the public safe from global threats and disseminating technological advances on a regular base, using the organization H.A.N.D as a secret police. As Stark rebels against the Maker, he imprisons both of them and Kang inside the city, leaving two years before it opens.

### King Thor

In King Thor's timeline, Doom acquired the powers of Iron Fist, Ghost Rider, Star Brand and Doctor Strange. He wanted to destroy the new mortals that appeared in a desolate Earth, but he was attacked by King Thor and Old Man Phoenix. During the battle, he killed Logan, which allowed the Phoenix Force to go to Thor right before Doom was about to use his Penance Stare to Thor. Now with the power of the Phoenix Force, Thor was able to defeat Doom.
